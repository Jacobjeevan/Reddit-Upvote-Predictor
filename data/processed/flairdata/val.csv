"I doubt it. The movie's horror tone will come from weird imagery (like the first film) and some jumpy/scary scenes, kind of like a less bloody *It*. There probably won't be an excess of vulgar language or anything too violent or disturbing. *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom* also invoked a lot of horror film tropes, especially in the second half when they're in the mansion, and it still got a 12 here in the UK.",__label__good

No. He just takes the stones out of his gauntlet when he takes it off. Simple. Thor 3 ends with Thanos reaching Thor's ship. It makes the most sense to start out IW from there. It gets the balls rolling with other plots sooner. Hulk is clearly zapped into Doctor Strange's place using the Space Gem most likely by Loki. Space Stone-> Power Stone -> Reality Stone(he doesn't have it so he probably fails here) -> goes for Earth's stones  ,__label__normal

"Really? I loved GotG2. It's probably my favorite marvel movie. I can't think of a time they ruin an emotional moment with a quirky one liner or something like that. I mean they do have a lot of it, but it kinda fits with the characters and their flaws.

Would've been a cool way to see *everyone* in costume in one, clear shot like  this. (url) As cool as *Portals* was, it was definitely a clusterfuck. And maybe with the same silence as the original death scene, and shorter than this, so that it didn't take the impact away from the funeral.",__label__good

"the problem with writing Captain Marvel is that the character was mostly flat to begin with  after Whiz Comics got sued by DC for making *their* Captain Marvel look too much like Superman in 1953, Marvel Comics snagged the name from the public domain and had to slap together a superhero from it so they wouldn t lose the copyright.  That s also why the Captain Marvel power set is kind of generic too. The name preceded the character instead of the other way around.",__label__good

I already knew it was ass but didn't follow it or even buy it anyway. I was wondering cause most of the Marvel stuff I see is crappy mobile games,__label__normal
Yes that Disney owns,__label__normal

"*we're in the endgame now.*   It was fairly obvious what it was potentially going to be. Great title, fits the movie",__label__poor
Because you cast this early. They have to film next year and the year after. Many actors were cast for roles 2-3 years early. Brie Larson was cast well over a year before she even filmed anything. Also 2021 is stuffed.,__label__good
Probably 1x1=0,__label__good
"I don't think keeping the timeline same would be too much of a priority. Cap's main objective was to return the stones to their respective timelines.

"In the early stages of the creating the MCU, were there times where you thought  maybe this isn t a good idea  or did you never feel that way despite how many people said it was sure to fail. Either way I m glad y all made these movies they re a huge part of my life",__label__normal
Spider-Man: Better Back Home.,__label__normal
Doctor Strange horror movie with Scarlet Witch costarring? Shit is gonna get as weird as it can,__label__normal
"I'd argue against it, because there are moments in season one that are too important to later seasons or that go into too much detail about the characters to skip. Episodes 14 and 17 are especially important, too. Honestly, it's probably just the first 10 episodes where they try to find their feet where the show is just eh, and then it ramps up from there and reaches a crescendo in episode 17 (and the season is great from thereon).",__label__normal
"To me, Wanda is a very powerful but unstable character. I doubt  regular  Wanda could defeat Thanos. But in the right  emotion , she could hold off 5-infinity-stone-powered Thanos. In Endgame, she has to kill her own boyfriend, succeeded, has to watch him dies again, and then erased from existence. Her emotion (and power level) must've been through the roof.",__label__best

"But if it costed 300 million to revenue 800 million, profit would be 500 million. 167  ROI. If they went 50/50 on the budget, Sony only has to fork out 150 million to revenue 500 million, profit would be 350 million. 233  ROI.",__label__normal

Marvel wasn't around when they were discussing the plan so she didn't know she needed a suit. she came to the battle midway through so she just assumed the goal was to get the gauntlet to the van with no idea what would happen if she made it there.

Yeah I don't think people realize how big a change the guardians thing is. They would have completed filming on it now and it would likely have been released in May 2020.

"Nor was End Game, we lost heroes in that too",__label__normal
"Sony is pinning an awful lot of hope on Venom. If you do the math, even if there's already a 50/50 split for Homecoming and Far From Home, Sony would still make more money from those films than ASM and ASM 2.

Hey Kevin. Thank you for everything youve done with the MCU and the astounding effort you put into Youve Got Mail. 2 quick questions. 1.

What you said here ties in to the main point of the character that many people don't get. His purpose is to show that even the strongest man in the world can't save everyone. He still fails. He is often faced with problems that he can't just punch to death and he is forced to be a leader and inspire others to make true change. His character shows the importance of having strong personal character instead of just physical strength. This is why he is inspiring.,__label__normal

I feel like if they would have made it back to Earth before the battle in wakanda they would have had a shot at beating Thanos all as one big team rather than taking turns fighting Thanos with a depleted team. Plus then Thanos wouldn t have been able to reverse time if Wanda destroyed Visions stone. They would have literally easily stopped him from getting all 6,__label__normal
"Now that you say it, there could have been a really cool scene on Titan where Strange opens a portal around thanos' gauntlet hand, like what he did to Cull Obsidian, but it can't close it. Would have been a great way to show off his raw strength without the gauntlet (although they did a pretty good job of that with the hulk fight). It almost seems like they were setting that up, but cut it out cause it didn't really make sense with strange already knowing what didn't work",__label__normal

I still consider Ant-Man's script as written by Edgar Wright.   The movie (specifically the comedy and pacing) just *felt* like an Edgar Wright movie.,__label__normal
It does indeed.,__label__poor

"Ah. The Winter Soldier fighting the Avengers one by one as he escaped was pretty badass. Plus the guy just WALKED everywhere when he was in Winter Soldier mode.

Brutal, fast, and neither felt like they were pulling punches.",__label__normal

"I guess I just don't get the purpose of editing those out if they did.  From everything we've heard Wakanda is the third act of the film, unless they have all been lying to us this entire time.  I just wonder if he doesn't have them by the Wakanda fight scene, but has sent out the Black Order to retrieve them and that is why we don't see Vision or Dr. Strange in that fight sequence.  Its because they tried to separate the stones so he couldn't get them.  Separate the lock and key. ",__label__normal
"If he'd have left that part out then it would have at least been *remotely* tongue-in-cheek, but the impulsive pettiness of a fanboy never fails to overshadow any sense of composure or self-awareness.",__label__normal

I do kind of miss when every superhero movie wasn t on a worldwide or galactic level. I feel like every movie I ve seen the past few years has been at a super big level.

well you also got to think about the fact that the biggest reason.

"I personally think it could have benefitted from cutting a lot of story.

I mean if you follow the  scientific  reasoning behind how it works dont think this would work. The scentific explanation was that all it does was increase or reduce space between atoms so no weight would be added or lossed.

Hela killed off a ton of their warriors in Ragnarok, Thanos killed another half that were on the ship, and then presumably another half got snapped.

"The MCU became such a powerhouse over the years and managed to get the rights to Xmen and the F4, while also securing a deal for Spidey.

">Also Hulk bursting out of the Hulkbuster would have been iconic. Kinda wish he did so when they went to The Farm in Endgame, even if briefly. He actually was planned to after finding out that there was no way to reverse the snap. He would have busted out of the armor, pissed, and Carol would have been trying to calm him down. Which explains an earlier on set report with Brie Larson interacting with The Hulk by putting her hands up in front of him.",__label__good

Not sure what to do with that statement. Other than that we humans have the unique ability to act differently than our instincts suggest.
