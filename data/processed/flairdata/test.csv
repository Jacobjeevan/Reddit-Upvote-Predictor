The big difference would be with Cap staying in the past, would he be able to resist changing things?

Marvel never really completely reboots anything. They just... Shake things up every year or two and give new status quos for heroes and release a bunch of  1's. DC reboots are like a brand new coffee made from scratch while Marvels soft reboots are like adding cream to coffee. Ultimately still the same liquid but with a different appearance.,__label__good

These people create  products  which care for both. You can download 10gb and 1-2 gb rips of the same movie. There is a quality difference between them but it's mostly noticeable on better screens and mostly if you know what to look for. And 2 gb is a very good size for streaming. Youtube uses about 2gb of memory for one HOUR of video at 1080p 30fps. You should expect better from a dedicated streaming service which streams movies not vlogs AND it's a paid service.,__label__normal

At the end of the day Disney is a kid friendly/family friendly company.  This guy made some hugely crass jokes about pedophilia and everyone is up in arms for Disney firing him?

I love both Ant-Man movies for the same reason. I like that they re small scale (heh) and family dramadies at their heart. They re fun and light and I can enjoy them with my little kids. I get that they re not super true to the comic characters but I m always surprised by how much this sub seems to dislike them. I rewatch them all the time bc they re like my go-to feel good movies.

Happy and Wong aren't. Dr. Strange isn't. A better way to look at it is that these are the central characters that are leading the narrative. Plus Pepper is probably going to end up becoming Rescue in this movie so at least from that perspective she'll be somewhat involved in the action.",__label__normal

I like Scarlet as an actress but as the movies went on her character started to suck. It seemed she was only around because she was the only female on the team. She has no powers and is boring. THen sometimes terrible bland acting by Scarlet.  In Infinity War the  she s not alone  was dubbed in. It was jarring when said. Horrible audio. Just like her character. Forcing her and Hulk together. Shitty.,__label__poor

"Which actor/actress is the most similar to their super hero persona/character?  Likewise, who is the most opposite? From a fans perspective, it seems like Chris Pratt shares a lot of commonalities with Starlord/Peter Quill, due primarily to wit/charisma.

Nothing short of amazing work... The only thing. Literally the only thing I could potentially say that does not degrade the video in anyway. The edges of the first scene are not covered in most of the other scenes. As such you can see white bar at the top and Hulks hair.

"Did Captain Marvel have any idea who Tony was?  She literally just showed up 5 minutes ago.   If anything her first thought would be  hey wait, isn't that an arms dealer? , although he may not have been as well known back before she was CM, or easily recognizable as that guy at the time of his death.  Also, Nebula kneels, and Gamora would take her cue from Nebula if anyone.",__label__normal

It's still a wild leap to assume they are dead. Why wouldn't they be showing others who we KNOW are dead? Suri was confirmed to survive the snap along with her mother. Wakandans have spent a lifetime in hiding and Black Panther begins with Nakia undercover. A much reasonable assumption is that they are in hiding and Bruce is looking at panels of people they are searching for who could be of assistance.,__label__best

I would have loved a scene where the surviving original Avengers members lift Tony s body or his coffin or something into their shoulders and carried him off (similar to Cap carrying his old love after her passing in Civil War). That would have broken me emotionally but I think it would have been a beautiful scene,__label__normal

He doesn t have to want to be apart of the Fantastic Four. His relationship with them is his main comic relationship with other heroes and it is not about him wanting to join them in anyway.
