These people create  products  which care for both. You can download 10gb and 1-2 gb rips of the same movie.

"On a side note about the MCU. It s very enjoyable to see how even in death, Stark s mistakes continue to haunt the world.  Like, sure the ultron project was misguided, we can give him that but like seriously, again with the drones? What happened to just doing regular hero stuff with the new generation?  Also, really stark, giving Parker glasses that can kill people at a moments notice? Could you just not?  Stark is really lucky that Parker is a great person who has a strong moral code.",best
"The only real failing was that it didn't use any of it's runtime to be that serious, which kind of left me wanting. Everything that is there is top-notch, but that just made what was missing more glaring.",best

Thanos isn't even the strongest villain we've seen so far in the mcu. That honour goes to Hela.  And he's definitely not going to be the strongest as the likes of doom and company are on their way.,good
"True but I would liked to have seen the finale to the hulk arc over the last 3 movies where he hulks out in the battle and Banner now has control over man and beast.  Instead of Captain Marvel, it should have been the rematch with Thanos.

"Being a plot device is kind of a waste for someone of Portman's caliber. Jane Foster was more or less just chauffered around Asgard, 'everyman'ing for the audience.

"the problem with writing Captain Marvel is that the character was mostly flat to begin with  after Whiz Comics got sued by DC for making *their* Captain Marvel look too much like Superman in 1953, Marvel Comics snagged the name from the public domain and had to slap together a superhero from it so they wouldn t lose the copyright.  That s also why the Captain Marvel power set is kind of generic too. The name preceded the character instead of the other way around.",good
"On the topic of LGBTQ representation in the MCU, and that the Russo's statement that a closeted gay character already exists in the MCU. There's a lot of speculation about who this is, and a lot of it falls on Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, but based on her personality I really feel she would be asexual, rather than gay. Thoughts on that and more representation in the MCU? P.s. I look forward to more representation like Joe Russo's character: natural, unforced, and not the butt of a joke.",normal

The occasional big team-up to tackle a huge threat is fine, but if the world is threatened every time, it's going to feel like the world just can't manage itself for one   minute. Likewise, stakes that are bigger than the world will rapidly grow stale. Who cares about the difference between the world burning and the entire solar system blowing up? Neither one is acceptable losses. Except in Thor 3...which handled it well.",normal

The Russos  justification for not including the Hulk/Banner union is because it was too victorious a moment for a movie like IW.

I feel like if they would have made it back to Earth before the battle in wakanda they would have had a shot at beating Thanos all as one big team rather than taking turns fighting Thanos with a depleted team.

"Now that you say it, there could have been a really cool scene on Titan where Strange opens a portal around thanos' gauntlet hand, like what he did to Cull Obsidian, but it can't close it. Would have been a great way to show off his raw strength without the gauntlet (although they did a pretty good job of that with the hulk fight). It almost seems like they were setting that up, but cut it out cause it didn't really make sense with strange already knowing what didn't work",normal

Hey Kevin! What superpower would you have if you had the choice?,poor
Was there ever a moment where you just felt like giving up after a movie failing or getting a ton of backlash?  I love what you ve done. Thank you.,normal
"Man, he should've been the one to fuck up Thanos's ships in EG. They straight up nerfed him just so Marvel would look better and he STILL ended up more likable. I really hope they can fix Captain Marvel, otherwise we'll get stuck with a shitty character for a whole phase. x200B Then again, Thor wasn't all that cool before Ragnorak either and they made him awesome. Then again again, he didn't come across as bitchy either. Idk, I hope they can make Marvel better.",normal
"I think that s Star Lord between Falcon and Bucky, second from the left.",good

What can you tell us about Shang-Chi?,normal
"I think it's his way of saying  Look guys, what I'm doing really isn't *that* bad, y'know? I've got the full ability to just fucking delete everyone, but I'm being nice enough to let 50  of you keep living. See? Not evil. Totally justified. Get over it. ",normal
Life-long marvel fan here! Thanks for all you've done to bring these characters and stories to life! Do you have a favorite character? Or maybe a top few without a particular order?,normal
I don t see Antman,good
I will never understand how people over 12 can watch super hero movies and actually enjoy them. ,poor
Feels like they already did that exact thing in the actual Guardians movie.,poor
"What are the odds Tony comes back as a cosmic being? or at the very least an AI? I know people say to get over it, but I am choosing not to. Bring back Tony. Please.",normal
Yeah it felt way too marvel-y to me,poor
Not to mention the countless times spent honing and creating spells while trapping Dormammu in a time loop. No telling how long it would take a cosmic being like that to actually feel like he had been beat.,normal
Asking for a friend.,normal
"I agree that it makes perfect sense, because Dr. Strange keeps track of nystical threats. Loki is a magic user, Thanos isn't. And it could also easily be that he doesn't have a very exhaustive list yet.  We need to come up with those actual reasons. Asgard is not another universe or dimension, and Thanos and Loki are equally alien.",normal
"They said Iron Man, not Tony Stark. Iron Man could come back somehow if they make a new character who uses the armor",normal
That is so fricking cool!!!!,normal
"Now that you mention Bruce, he doesn't seem to be in uniform with the others...",good
"Jude Law is way too big of a star to be a sidekick, and he's not old enough to be a trainer/mentor.   He *could* be her Kree senior officer that turns out to be a Skrull in Captain Marvel 2, but odds are he's today's bad guy. ",poor

Agent Maria Hill should have been included instead of Loki,normal
"This was a while ago, but they also made the *best* live action Spiderman there has ever been. Into the Spider Verse tells me that Sony probably learned to give creative control to talented studios. I have no doubts Sony will be fine if Disney keeps pushing them away.",normal

glad it isn t called annihilation that sounded so shit,normal
 I  actually  prefer  him  like  this.,normal
"I m thinking his second appearance after the sequel to FFH will be an Avengers film, he needs to be front and center. Would also be a good way to influence another deal after this ones over",normal
"And because of his special and intimate relationship, was almost like losing a loved one",good

I've always liked it. I've had watches that were less fun than others but it's pretty solid.  I recommend Black's  The Nice Guys . Underrated film.,normal
"I m aware, which is why saying Hulk was a supporting character is a large mischaracterization",good
I hope Jeremy Renner/Hawkeye is in this film. They could make it about Widow being recruited into Shield and partnering with Barton. I really loved them in Endgame.,normal
Then don't buy smart shit it's not that hard.,good
"Yes, around the time of SDCC she was confirmed.",normal
"A cultural phenomenon needs to be lasting.  Star Wars was a cultural phenomenon.  Harry Potter was a cultural phenomenon.  The MCU is a cultural phenomenon. When the only thing people remember from Avatar was blue people and unobtanium, that's a cultural fad",normal
How is it *not* offensive? It's not like any movie critic chose to be a white man.,poor
"Yup, that's definitely a *Captain Marvel* trailer. ",normal
"They don't care if it's good, they care if it makes money. Spider-Man will pretty much always make money unless they really really mess it up. They can continue rebooting every 3 films, churning out mediocre crap, and they'll still make money.",normal
"TDW is about Thor and Loki s relationship, and Thor finding his place in the world, which is giving up the Asgardian quests and being on Earth, where he feels he has meaning.",best
I love what they did with Prof. Hulk in the movie but personally i dont think they earned using him.,normal
can t get over how good this photoshop is,normal
I'd really really be surprised if it was that long. ,normal
I think it would be amazing! Origin stories are always wanted as they engage the cinematic audience. Something fresh but familiar.,normal
 I'm gonna go kill yakuza! ,poor
"I would love that. Not necessarily with Street Fighter: The Game, but any fighting game where 4K PS4 Pro characters square off against 16-bit era MK digitised sprites with about 5 moves.",good
Happy trails space cowboy ,normal
You should! It's one of if not the best solo movie in the MCU. It's my favorite. Made me a fan of Captain America.,normal
> middle Eastern chick my memory is a bit foggy but I dont remember anything in particular about her ethnicity in the show,good
"Dude, from the moment Thor forged Stormbreaker until the end of IW is basically an evidence",normal
Thats why she looked familiar to me... *Au pair*,normal
lol no he hasn t - he can do that in his own tv show. this film should be from Nat s perspective.,good
My mistake then. I thought this last one was the end.,normal
"In fairness, that shot could be anything. Could be alternate universe that never happens. Could be Tony fever dream. Could be altered for the trailer and look totally different in final cut.",normal
Damn. Will they just chilling him into future movies now?,normal
"I only used the high school comparison because I'm a shut-in who doesn't talk to people anymore lmao, it honestly applies to anyone who used to belong to a subculture where it was common to say things that would be considered offensive by the mainstream culture of today.",poor
Ugh if only he had made thousands of child rape  jokes  though then everything would be gravy...,poor
The lettering could use some work. There is so much air. And two words should mostly never be above one short word.,normal

"Hi Kevin, quick question here. Is the goal of the MCU to have Carol fill the role of someone like Superman ( very powerful central figure)? Or she intended to be used sparingly because of her huge power level?",normal
Ahhh yeah. I forgot Origin existed. Thanks for ruining my bliss!  ),normal
Man...just like Highschool Football.,normal
"Yeah Morty, now let's check the microverse battery",normal

"> and then just travels back.. If so, he should have shown up in the machine, not sitting on a suit in the bench.  They pretty firmly established that when you travel back, you show up in the machine. > the laziest part about that scene was that they didnt show him travel back for the dramatic effect And what, everyone was distracted and didn't notice him coming back, changing out of his time-travel suit, and going over to sit on the bench?",normal
And people in the YouTube comments were saying she had a deadpan face and no emotions whatsoever.  I think this is why I like Reddit comments more. ,best

I m avoiding trailers for the MCU.  Could anyone let me know if the trailer says when tickets go on sale?  I m assuming/hoping soon since this trailer just dropped,normal
This legitimately looks crazy. I don't think there's ever been so much CG in unison with the environment like this before. Just look at the shot of the Wakanda shield. You can see everything happening.,normal

"That s why you dont see stuff like that happening all the time. Not to sound horrible, but its pretty obvious when someone is seriously ill.",normal
My guess is Hank Pym set him up with the house post Ant-Man and pre Civil War.,normal
I thought I was on drugs when I saw that,normal
Pepper Potts is still around. At this point Tony probably had Iron Man suit repairs/construction automated. She'll have access to all that. Now creating updated suits thats probably not happening unless Wakanda gets involved.,normal
Yeah I saw that. Curious. Wonder if she s a stand in for someone else? ,normal
What was your favorite Stan Lee cameo? Thank you for everything you have done. You should be very proud of yourself,normal

"Since when is budget (or reach) a factor in whether something has more or less prestige? Most arthouse films have a really small budget compared to Hollywood stuff, but carry a lot of prestige and certainly aren't beneath Hollywood films. Also, those same arthouse films have way less reach than Hollywood films.",poor
>Ohhh snap!,best
"Well that s impressive, it doesn t even look like cardboard. I totally thought it was a wood carving",best
Not enough humor in the 30 second trailer? gee,good
It is an easy way to start the action/plot.,normal
"After the CM trailer a bunch of people were complaining that Brie Larson should smile more in the movie and that she lacked personality. The  smile more  is a common sexist criticism of women, but moreover, her goddamn character is a brainwashed warrior slave and no one seemed to consider how that may affect how often she smiles. ",best
I need to rewatch that film... I like the ideas of it and maybe that's all you need for a moment to be remembered... But as I remember it it all felt a bit forced and ehhhhh in execution. Yeah deffo need a second viewing,normal
"Well yeah. He's not legally able to be a superhero (at the beginning of the movie at least - it's possible the Accords could get repealed or put on hold or simply ignored while Thanos is a threat), and he abandoned the shield. So he's given up the identity, for now at least.",best

All too often I read stuff like  main Harry Potter cast *hated* working on the movie,  even in the MCU there are rumors that Chris Evans, Hemsworth, and RDJ were tired of their roles in the MCU. I mean I get it, but it s nice to know that they actually enjoy the roles of a lifetime, the story, the epicness, etc.",best

Marvel should cast him as another new hero with weirdly similar arachnid powers and the memory of Peter Parker. Arachnid-Dude.,normal
"I'd say she's way more interesting than Hawkeye, or at least was until endgame. Now they're maybe tied.

Just a family man doing good to provide for/protect his family.",normal

"They had a pretty solid supporting cast. Natalie Portman was fresh off an Oscar win and Anthony Hopkins always brings a lot of credibility. Hugo Weaving is mildly famous, I think the average audience would recognize him but not know his name.

Though it seemed like a part of his arc at the end of Civil War it seems like the Black Panther is kind of soft and watered down compared to his comic book counterpart in the films since Civil War. Any plans to get the character back to the roots? Smarter? More brutal?,normal

"Not the same if half the world s farmers are gone (or more, given that the snap likely isn t granular in dividing groups of people), and crops are left to rot in fields or the food distribution system collapses without truck drivers or people to process the crops and refine plants into food.

Roseanne and Allen have made openly racist/bigoted remarks very recently, and rather than owning up to it and apologizing, tried shifting the blame off of themselves. Gunn was specifically targeted by Trump cultists, and never would have been in trouble were it not for their active measures.

"Idk why any of them would leave tbh. It seems like a lot of fun, they can get paid better than they will anywhere else, the studio works around people s schedules like they did for cumberbatch during IW so they can still do more serious projects. The only reason I could think of is if hemsworth or Evans decide they don t want to have to maintain the harsh steroid, diet and workout regimens their roles entail, but they re still in their mid 30s. That didn t get to Hugh Jackmans breaking point till 50. ",normal

Kind of like how in the current Carnage line Venom seperates from Eddie because Eddie wanted to save someone instead of killing Carnage so Venom leaves him and takes over the Hulk.",good

"False, it s not suddenly just an addition of 40 pounds, the entire purpose of that was the show how depression had enveloped Thor. He spent 5 years wallowing in his own pity. He did nothing but drink, game, and eat poorly. I would most definitely say he was around half strength, although still noticeably strong he was nothing compared to his former self and it was very noticeable in how he dealt with 1 on 1 physical capabilities",normal

In the MCU there are no streaming wars. The influx of superheroes and aliens made cable news so important that it slowed down the move away from cable TV. Netflix was still sending CDs in the mail when The Snap happened and the entertainment industry was decimated. In the theatres of the MCU there is nothing like the MCU. There might be superhero movies but nothing is making a billion dollars. The biggest movies in the world turn out to be true stories about surviving the Snap and musicals.,good

Considering the first one made  880M or so, then I think they are playing with fire since the backlash / fan boycott will definitely hit it. They only got 1B because it immediately followed the biggest movie of all time. I think they'll be lucky to get  700 with the MCU.",normal

Even James admitted that he was doing it at a time when he wanted to get a rise out of people. The way that James took the movie with dignity and didn't shirk it or belittle it at all really was amazing and set a tremendous tone for how these things ought to be handled.
