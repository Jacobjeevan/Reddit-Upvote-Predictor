Just an orgy of sexy superhero men. ,1
Would love if it has time travel and if such if Andros Stark (Tony's grandson and the Iron Man of 2099) shows up and helps the Avengers fix The Decimation.,1
 A traffic jam when you're already late...,1
Boatside Carbunkle s Dr Strange has some  splaining to do about the  one timeline  that worked in MAv: InfiWars,1
"From those of us not versed in the comics, fucking thank you :D",3
that's aaaamazzzziinnnggg,1
All those new haircuts lol,1
The sub goes through some  down  periods in between big events. It s normal. Guarantee it ll pick up as we get closer to Black Widow.,3
JJJ should be played by alex jones if this were to actually happen,1
HAHAHAHAHHA,1
"I mean the story itself is essentially the same, except that Groot isn t the same character anymore, so the experience of watching it is a little different. It also means that Groot *actually* died in GotG1, which is also kinda crazy",3

What about Thanos Car?,1
"Considering the climate, you know a guy is alright when his fellow celebs come out this hard to support him for regrettable rape jokes in his past.",1
Maybe his parents bought it and gave it to him?,1
"I guess you could say more of a status. A Ronin in Japan is a masterless samurai that wanders around the country. Really the main point here is to show that he's alone now, which is why it's pretty safe to assume his family got snapped.",1
"Honestly I'm fine with that. The Sony Spider-Verse films likely won't contradict the MCU in any significant way, and it'll be great to see Holland's Parker interacting with the rest of the Spider-Man rouges gallery. Not every Marvel film need to intimately connect to the rest of the universe.",1
"So if a guy is dressed as a big baby and his girlfriend is there with him, she's a pedophile? Or mocking pedophilia?",2
"I wasn t thinking a multi-camera comedy, just a comedic take like the comics not a drama.  I think the  confessional mockumentary  style that s in vogue now since The Office and Modern Family would work out really well for this theme.",1
I hate how his axe was unstoppable in IW but in endgame it wasn t. Makes no sense.,0
This comment is on 6699 points right now.  Double nice.,1
You forgot the part where Sony does at the end.,1
"Nah, this is a perfect case for r/nocontext over r/evenwithcontext",3
"I am just going to leave this here:  Disney cant, wont ever hire James Gunn back     -Grace Randolph ",2
nope.  you're the confused one (https://www.thewrap.com/avengers-endgame-where-loki-go-with-the-tesseract-space-stone-time-new-york-2012/). that timeline didn't exist until loki created it.,0
She was basically on par with Tony in terms of possible technology for them. She would have been the plug had she survived the snap.,2
It's become a big thing in sports now too. The age of the internet. ESPN:   Oh look at this top draft prospect using curse words and being derogatory in these tweets from when he was 13!   Me:  Yep that was a Lil Wayne song alright. ,3
"They said something along the lines of  virtue signaling  being all the rage on Reddit, the commenter should just like who they like. It was really needless when your explanation was so measured and fair.",1
"I wondered about this though. We never saw how close Shuri got to finishing her removal of the stone. I wouldn t be surprised to find out she was almost done, and while Thanos fucked his shit up when he ripped it out of his head, she had gotten far enough that she can repair what s left and get Vision back up and running.  Edit: I just looked at the poster again, and it looks like Shuri got dusted, so unless Tony or Banner does the repair job, probably not going to happen.",1
Why does there need to be a culture war? Is there a reason we can t just accept other people living side by side with different beliefs (assuming those beliefs don t harm living people).,3
"Just wait until Phase 4 when the OG Avengers get retired and the new ones take over, then there will be the small splinter of OG fans that argue anything not OG is terrible... I hate it but it's definitely coming.",3
Good luck with all your liberal buddies that want to jump on everything. They will not hire him back. It's a shame because I really like his work. And you guys are all under contract for the next movie,1
"RDJs Tony was my favourite character and I was very sad when he left, but it was for the best, for everyone.  But you nerds really need to let go of this shit. Tony is gone, RDJ isn t coming back. I hope he doesn t because his arc was perfect. Let him Rest In Peace.  A new Iron Man by another character and actor will rise. Just as they have always done in the comics.  Let go of Tony, you dicks.",0
"Oh my god...  Endgame ? What the fuck, dude? Is this a Mission Impossible movie, now? Edit: I know it s not a Mission Impossible movie, I was just commenting on what a stupid subtitle  endgame  is. For those that were confuse... okay cool!",1
"Truth hurts, right honey. Hahahaha",1
 Maybe the security company he runs with the others is doing really good.  ,1
Strange is gonna be around for a long time. The original 4 are all in danger. ,2
Didn't marvel recently confirm that he was immortal?,2
I can confirm Disney plus looks different on different devices. I used it on my ps4 pro first and then I downloaded on my lg smart tv and me and my gf both noticed a huge difference,1
I came to say this. I figured somebody would have by now. Have an upvote!,1
"In reply to all the above, never had her own film though, and making a film that addresses  issues  is a good path to getting an Oscar or two.",0
Could this be the first Avengers film without a big army of baddies at the end??,1
im sorry idk who that is,1
And Chris Hemsworth. And maybe Zendaya. And Benedict Cumberbatch.,1
Those other 14 million timelines have to watch Thanos win.,1
Except for captain marvel.,0
Fix the next movies section for some of the characters,1
I like this one!!,1
"Give him the screening anyway. Faking or not, we won't hear about him again afterwards. Choose to believe and let everyone get some good out of it. ",1

That laugh is still Andy Dwyer. No matter the role.,3
"I've wanted a proper story of Overwatch ever since it has released. I LOVE the world and feel a multiplayer game wasn't enough to do it justice (Overwatch 2 pve aside). Don't get me wrong, I would love these video game movies to do well so many non gamers can experience these amazing worlds. They just never seem to connect with that audience, gamers won't to play in that world and it just doesn't seem to work watching it.",1
unironically using pleb lmao,2
"Hi Kevin, huge fan of all the work you ve put into this universe over the past 11 years.  The MCU often has lots of build ups to movies from several years past such as the first Avengers teasing Thanos. How far in advance are these setups typically planned for future movies, and is it usually intended for the purpose of payoff later?",1
How much time you got?,0
"What's your proudest moment of the past 10 years, whether it be casting, movie release, or just being a fan?",1
Left is infinitely better. Right looks like she's mad that the kid at Burlington isn't accepting her coupon to buy that coat,1
 Here s (https://bamsmackpow.com/2018/04/11/doctor-strange-dark-dimension-time/) an article about it.   He was fighting Dormammu for a long time. I thought I read somewhere possibly thousands of years and he honed his craft while looping.  Pretty freaking awesome.,3
Did you really skip paying bills?,3
I feel like the whole concession stand is her wage in the movie.  ,1
"Its exactly what we all excepted though. Vision is at the top of everybodies list of people likely to die in this movie. He is built around a stone, and Thanos will not be denied his stones.",1
Absolutely gorgeous.  Well done  ,1

"Hey Kevin! Big fan of the MCU, I ve seen Endgame 4 1/2 times! (I had to leave a showing early because of an emergency)  I was wondering: Can we all look forward to a big announcement in a the near future of the next part of the MCU like we got with Infinity War back in 2014? Thank you so much for doing your part in the guiding of the MCU so far, it s so great to have someone that obviously loves these characters have such a big role in how they are presented to other fans!",2
"Yea well Endgame has 10yrs/21 films of story building behind pal. Obviously the hype won t be as big for something that s been built upto for so long. Avatar was an absolute spectacle and no theatric experience has ever come close. The fact that it did 2.8B with not even as big as a cast list as EG,Way lesser hype and marketing than EG is just mind-boggling. Credit where it s due. It s time at the top may well be over but still.",1

"Bold of you to assume that a woman would ever get close enough to you for you to have children. (Unless you force yourself onto a woman, which I get the feeling you d be okay with.)

"What sucks is that Sony believes they are responsible for Spiderman's success. They're not, Disney is. Without the MCU connections and the Avengers it would never have been as successful.",1
"Hi Kevin! Thanks so much for taking the time to do this. One of my favorite things about the MCU is its range in storytelling--from fun, popcorn Marvel Studios flicks to the darker, grittier Marvel TV shows. As the MCU enters Phase IV, and taking into consideration Disney's acquisition of Fox and Hulu/creation of Disney+ , what are the chances that we get some adult-oriented, Marvel Studios properties, whether in theaters or on one of the streaming services?",1
Think that s kind of Thanos s point,3
Apology means nothing. Especially since that is coming out now that there is actual consequences to his discussing behavior. Matured what... since he was 40?! You re ok with him saying that stuff?,2

I hate catchy choruses and I m a hypocrite,3
That's because Thanos knows to go for the head,2
Great Odin's Raven!,1
"I mean they technically could, but it wouldn t make sense. We don t see the Ancient One tremble when fighting world-ending evil, and it s not like she d hold back because  eh, this guy s not as bad as Thanos . Whereas Stephen Strange s entire personal journey was about coming to grips with his disability.",3
Beta Ray Bill or I strike. Gimme some o' that horse headed heroism.,1
"im glad they removed this because it takes away from his death. previously i was completely focused on tony and the loss, but this makes me suddenly think  omg that person reacted like that, are they going to kneel? how is so and so going to kneel? oh shit why didn't that person kneel   ect. like too much sudden distraction immediately after a grave moment",1

"Black Widow, The Wasp and Captain Marvel all have pretty sexualised outfits, similar to the comics. Surely Wanda is the only human female who doesn't fit the pattern? Black Widow spends her first few movies making gratuitous ass shots.",0
"Can t they just set those movies in the TASM universe? If they really want Spider-Man for these movies **and** in the MCU I don t understand why they can t just let Marvel do the stories they want, while Sony make their TASM movies. That would give us a movie every year and nobody would complain. This would also allow them to make the darker movies they originally intended.",3

"There is one around here! Though I just watch, I haven t played since platinum, though can t wait to afford my switch and dig into the new game when it comes out! Sword and shield HYPE!",1
I don t think you understand what that word means,1
Trump has yet to show any sign of thinking that was wrong so no he isn't forgiven and hasn't even started the road to redemption there. ,2
"Damn that s a way I ve never thought about it before. I never thought he lost since he didn t die or get dusted. But Batman lost the woman he loved, the only hero who could stand up to crime without a mask, and had to go on the run. That s definitely a loss",1
"You can't convince me that this wasn't the plan all along (once the cast wrote that letter).  Gunn goes quiet, gets rehired for Suicide Squad, WB gets any heat and Disney get to quietly  rehire  him in the week after a huge release and a day after a surprise trailer drop. I'm SO glad he's back. Needed this today.",1
"That s a misconception and doesn t do anything for your ads, you can put however many you want in there without a time limit ",1
I hope he sticks around as hulk hasn t been given a lot in recent times,1
I would guess Hulu. I don't think they'll want to confuse general audience/streamers with the old canon X-films when they are inevitably working on rolling out their MCU canon X-franchise(s). Also nooooo way is Logan or Deadpool winding up on D+ due to their R-ratings. I would guess Deadpool will hit hulu before their version of him hits theaters to drum up hype. X-Men.....idk that may be years.,1

I wasn't sure if that Collector footage was from part 3 or 4 or if he's successful in finding the stone from him. Other contenders I've heard from the Soul Stone could be the Eternal Flame (with the power of resurrection) from Asgard or in with Adam Warlock in his cocoon as he's the most commonly associated character with that stone.,1
Remember when Howard the Duck was the only Marvel movie out?  ,3

These are some great questions.,1
Why would I want a prequel that adds to a dead character,1
"No spoilers, but Rudd's performance in endgame is amazing. The dude nearly had me in tears at multiple points.",3
He doesn't give a fuck. Disney is forcing their actors to make posts like this.,0
Its extra ironic that he's co-signing and doubling down on Scorsese's theme park comment when he literally directed a movie for a theme park (Captain EO).,3
People who don't believe that:  Oh I don't think so ,3
Is Captain Marvel supposed to be in this?,1
My only regret is that Disney+ doesn't release shows like Netflix and Amazon.  Let me watch a whole season on my own schedule instead of having to carve out an hour every week.  It's the new norm and they are behind in only that respect...,1
Same to you.,3
"On this very scene, when Howard says they're expecting, Tony's face is like wtf, like he didn't knew that. Can someone explain this moment?",3
Hi Kevin! Thanks for making this possible! What s one regret you have that couldn t make it to film during the first 3 phases?,1
 Are you Gordon? Yeah. Who are you? I'm the guy who kills Gordon ,3
Wheres is Drax?,1
Not my future,1
Oh please. Marvel movies are pandering and formulaic. Hardly call those pieces of shit  art .,1
What was that switch Ant-Man flipped?  The New suits look awesome.  THOR AND CAROL PUMPED ME UP.  Somebody cryogenically freeze me till April 24 midnight. ,1
I heard he actually likes the suit and wanted it to be in more scenes,3
So wait... there's a chance that Avengers: Endgame and Game of Thrones final season premiere could be on the same weekend?? ,1
"Hi Kevin, is there any future plans for the Hulk? I know it's not likely he'll get an individual movie but I'd really like to see him again in any of the MCU movies.",1
Ragnarok was different than any MCU movie.,2
Or maybe someone on the Titanic yells  Iceberg straight ahead!!!  and Thanos just snaps his fingers and the Iceberg turns to dust and he says  Not anymore   or  what Iceberg? ,1

It's a teaser. We'll get more fleshed-out trailers some time in the 6 months before it comes out.,1
"You're right, nobody ever said it, but it's just the reality of the situation:  There are only a finite amount of jobs in each industry, so if you're forcing in people that you want represented, you're forcing out people that are already there.",1
"The Thunderbolts are basically Marvel's suicide squad. They are a team of former* villains usually working for the US Government. There is usually a hero thrown in too. Red Guardian hasn't been on the team, but Yelena has. Red Guardian is basically Russia's Captain America. He is a hero in the sense that he is Russia's hero (which often makes him a villain to the heroes).   *not always former",2
That's disgusting.,1
Do all those sorcerers still exist in the current timeline?,3
"Also convenient that this happens one week after another studio  stands by  a personality that had a bunch of disgusting comments from a decade ago dug up (comments that were, IMO, even worse than Gunn's as they didn't even have the excuse of being jokes).",1
Just don't believe anything they say in the first place. They've done this kind of thing a million times. Hulk wasn't in Wakanda etc.,2
This confirms the sub atomic theory,1
"I'm talking scorched earth, motherfucker!",3
 Yeah it's a lot of unnecessary running. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XslcgQJMZaY),1

"MidCredits: Thor and guardians go to the collector, looking for the aether. When they get there, it is being guarded by a golden man who goes by the name of Adam warlock.

"Hi Kevin, Have you ever considered coming to NYC (the original home of Marvel) for NYCC when it comes to announcing new projects or holding  In Production  panels? I know that SDCC is closer to Marvel Studios ... but hear me out.

Love - An East Coaster who can't make it to SDCC.",1
Ha ha ha ... But grateful that they have agreed.,1
Remembering Stan Lee for his cameo's would be like remembering the Beatles for walking across a road that one time. Edit: fired auto correct,3

"I was 12 when Iron Man came out in 2008. After the introduction of every single other Marvel character, Tony Stark remained my favorite the whole time. I dont have a background in the comics or anything...but I've grown to love the Marvel cinematic universe. Although it's very sad how Tony's story ended...it couldnt have ended better any other way. Thank you Tony...and RDJ for growing up with me!",1
In a movie titled  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse Of Maddness  I don t think there needs to be a relationship,2
"I feel like they could have had an easier solution than just cutting her. They could have had her come in earlier during the dinner at the farm. Just say Fury called in a friend to help, and she's waiting outside. She joins and she's epic. Easy and less  Where did she come from?  We can still have her origin in the 90s movie.",1
I don t think you re wrong at all. I just also don t think it s accurate to say that he had no character development. I think it s very clear that he was not the same person in 2023 as he was in 1943,3
THERE WAS AN IDEA,3
What is the correct order to watch all marvel movies and shows?,2
Just got out of Endgame for a second time. Where did 2014 Thanos and Nebula get more Pym particles to send Thanos and his ship back after 2014 Nebula came back using up the original pym particles?,1
How long until someone comes up with the laughing Chris version?,3
Finally we ll get to see Adam Warlock!!!,1

"I didn't mind that scene, but the following one when she had the gauntlet and the whole shes not alone scene made no sense at all after it.

Doubt Disney re-releases in theaters.,1
"comic book movies in general but more the ones made by Marvel. If they were standalones I could get behind them more. I could watch Commando and be fulfilled but after watching Marvel movies its like there is no true end because theres gonna be a sequel, and they create all these other movies to intertwine, so now you have to watch all these other movies so you can be IN on it.

"Disney have made Spider-Man popular again, they deserve it. Sony are just going to run Spider-Man into the ground.",0
Seriously. Even her role as Padm  was more proactive than anything that happened in Thor.,1
I said it was better than Avatar!,1
This is under the assumption Marvel/Disney went all-in on Spider-Man to be the face of the next saga. I find it hard to believe Feige wasn t prepared for potentially losing Spider-Man.,1

What a beautifully radiant smile you have!,1
I feel like her career must be a huge disappointment for her. She easily could have been the biggest actress in Hollywood of her game at the time of thor 2 kept on track... But it didn't.,0
 Ironhead s Apocalypse (url)  LaMonica Garrett as The Monitor (url),2
"While I hate that they canceled the show, ending it so early and abruptly ensures that it remains a masterfully done show without a poor conclusion that ruins the entire vibe of the series.",3
That would be a perfect one-shot to start off the next generation of movies. ,1
I guess people would rather downvote than answer a question.  Shitheads.  Just found out who she is thanks to noone here. ,0
I really hope we get to see Wong act as a stand-in for Strange for a little bit during Endgame,1
This never fails to crack me up  ,1

"Right - I m saying the whole premise is stupid. Conservation of energy is pretty set in stone, and they never even attempt to explain why pym particles violate it. I get it s a superhero thing, but even Spider-Man s webs kind of make sense. Selectively altering somethings mass without a nuclear explosion is just... so wrong.",1
"Yo, where the shield at?",2
Yeah.  Great job.  Didn't ask to get banned though.,0
"I also read it as a way to invite the casuals who caught Infinity War's end-credit scene. A lot of us cheered when we saw her logo on the beeper, but I also heard a lot of whispered,  What is it?  and  Who?  when someone explained its significance",0

What's the hardest movie you had to make?,1
Friends  Seinfeld,1
"They realized releasing shitty CGI Coon is a bad call..... Plus he's in Wakanda, you give Rocket access to some of the best weapon building material, where do you think he's going to go? *Also he's stuck on Earth, no ships to get him home or into space are left. Thor doesn't seem to be up to summoning the bi frost.",1
"Jesus Christ, that is disgusting.",0
Exactly. Gamora was accidentally taken from a time in which no one loved her. No one misses her.,1
"I mean I know you re kidding but it can t be a coincidence that Agents of SHIELD has been closely linked to the Kree since season 1 where Coulson got the details of his resurrection mindwiped, and now we re seeing what looks to be the same kinda deal in a movie that heavily involves the Kree. ",1
Wouldn't it be just as easy to bring Gamora back as bringing everyone else back.,1
Thanos is never shown with more than two stones in the trailer iirc. In the Wakanda fight he only has space and power stones when Cap tries to fight him off,3
"Hi Kevin. I was wondering over the last how many years, what has been your favorite moment (doesn't have to be from the movies) of being the president.?",0

"Hi Kevin! As far as having an overarching vision/plan for the MCU, how much of a hand do you have in the creation of the storylines from movie to movie? And do you and your team have backups in place for when things go awry (such as the originally planned Inhumans film)? Lastly I know you're a huge fan of Marvel but how often do you learn new things about characters in the Marvel universe as you're figuring out which characters to use in the MCU?",1

I hope the introduction of mutants is more like  Wanda (or the infinity stones if they wanna do that) causes a burst of energy that ignites the mutant gene in people all over the world  and less  mutants come through a portal from another universe and they're just here now . It feels more impactful to keep it in-universe imo.,3

"My gf hasn't seen ANY of the movies so I'm on a rewatch with her. Its like going back in time and remembering all the emotions all over again. This is where DC failed, they didn't invest in the movies. You can't expect loyalty to any of your characters if you haven't invested the time in building them up. Disappointing since I was a DC fan before a Marvel fan. ",2

If a new threat emerges and it's not secret, Captain America wouldn't let it slide. ...then again, the Mandarin kinda went under his radar. I take it back, the plotholes will make up for it.

"I don't think it causes story conflicts if each cinematic universe is allowed to reference each other through dialog. The whole point of the Marvel multiverse was to maintain canon within each individual reality, and Spider-Men have hopped through realities.

I love that Paul Rudd and Chris Pratt are next to each other,1
This might be my most favorite thing on the internet.,1

Nah you fired,1
"Hmm I feel like Whedon made the justice league movie largely more presentable than synder would have. I look at aquaman, and without that one scene with the lasso that Whedon added, he would've just been a bro character saying  my man . Whedon humanized him. And the little Whedon-isms throughout the movie made it more enjoyable than a heavy amd exhausting Synder movie. I'm not saying the movie was good but I think a Synder movie with Whedon revisions is much better than probably a raw Synder movie  ",2
TOASTY!,2

For some reason I only think of Brie Larson in mom roles because of Short Term 12 and Room which are movies I love. She's young and childless irl but the maternal quality she exhibited in those roles convinced me. That's why it's so weird to see her as a superhero. I can't wait to see this.,1

How is this something that doesn't age well? At the time they weren't as big of stars as other people. There is nothing in this which hasn't aged well unless you're saying that someone who became famous after an article which called them not-as-famous-as-others is poor aging.,0
Dracula you fucking nerd Edit:  reference (https://pics.me.me/i-know-youre-here-dracula-you-big-fucking-nerd-wheres-36831753.png),3
Every movie is out-of-shape Thor.,1
The  famous gif ,2
"Allegedly Jack Black wanted to star in the movie and make the Green Lantern as a sleazy comedy, with the idea of him creating a condom with the lantern's powers.",1
"Hi Kevin, I know you probably can't answer (at least not specifically,) but can you at least give us a hint as to when we might see MCU X-Men? Are there characters we're more likely to see sooner than others? Maybe Gambit?",1
No what do YOU mean YOU people!,1
This 20 minutes thing wasn't about the first trailer only? ,2
gifs you can hear,1
At least now they can actually continue on from the FFH post-credits scene,1
His name is Wong. And he is hilarious and powerful.,3
Bronn and Cersei were one of the few I have heard about that can t.,2
"That article is retarded. Sure some of those are bad, but they are nitpicking some pretty irrelevant things. Like I wouldn t be surprised if he complained that a human torch drawing was bad because people can t survive being on fire.",3
"Well really only two were on earth at the beginning of all this.  Just Space, hidden there by Odin, and Time, hidden in Kamar-Taj by a past Sorcerer Supreme.  And I would think Odin and the Sorcerer Supreme are some of the most worthy defenders of stones. ",3
"Oh sorry! Even so, it's been over two months and the movie is already out digitally. I just felt like I shouldn't have to censor myself at this point. I still feel bad for ruining it for you though. I didn't know.",1
The actor confirmed last year that he does indeed have super powers. ,2
I know ima make it through,1
"Goddamn, that was clean as fuck!",1
"While the last name is probably a dealbreaker at this point, hasn't Sean Gunn done some directing as well? ",2
Maybe but if they added more to her story in that movie instead of just her and Vision and her on Titan it would have been cool to see more of Thanos  backstory and motives,2
"yeah, gunn hasn't addressed it at all. spread this if you can. tons of people are supporting him because mike cernovitch is supposedly a huge prick, but that's like shooting the messenger. it shouldn't matter if it's adolf hitler calling someone a pedo, as long as they have evidence. people are brushing off the accusations so easily just because they like his movies.  edit: why the downvotes? seriously",0
"Agreed. They fit him into the MCU in an way that made him most impactful on the story. Making him close with Tony worked on many levels, including being what pushed Tony over the top and decide to go through with the time heist. But both of Spidey's solo films were about how he needs to rely on himself and his powers and not Stark tech.",3
"Exactly. And this is what amas should be, personalized... Other than the mandarin nugget, this felt pretty.. Cold.",1
"If he does, there will be tons of click-bait sites tomorrow titled:  These are the 10 storylines will see in the future of the MCU  CONFIRMED ",1
It seems you have no idea what I said or meant and are arguing about a point I didn't make...,2
Oh easily. They aren't even a challenge. The power scale of some mutants is just off the charts. https://screenrant.com/marvel-most-powerful-mutants-ranked-weakest-strongest/,1
https://imgur.com/a/KDJ1v4X Apparently also some guy asked for her number and she is get super upset idk,1
 But everything changed when Thanos snapped ,3
">I also think Captain Marvel will be the new lead of the Avengers.  God I hope not. Bree Larson is a very talented actress, so her being so cardboard in Captain Marvel was a shock to me. I only hope it was because the filmmakers just didn t give her anything to work with (given her lines in the film I assume so), but after how long it took to make Thor movies good I don t wanna wait again. ",1
"Don t like the cleavage in the first one, but like the design in general better",0
"So happy for you, man! Wishing you the best of luck on the rest of your journey!",1
"Maybe its a really expensive hand made doll house..... you know  2500 for a doll house..... and a lot of land that seems to keep making houses dissappear, would be cheap.",1
"He was great in Snowpiercer, but that was filmed around the time Avengers wrapped, so he had already been in TFA.",2
"I feel like I'm either blind or falling for a joke, because I don't see him.",3
"He s just so talented, does well in dramatic pieces (Narcos: Mexico for example) or comedies  like this",3
( Unironically ) came here to say this. It's such a Hollywood thing to do. Like he's sitting at home with a glass of wine going  I just *love love love* the contours on my jawline in this one. ,1
Did we not watch the same version of Far From Home?,3
But many necks were harmed during the flip-around-move-thingy she does,3
Upvoting just coz of jacksfilms,1
Which movie would you want to  redo  with how the infinity saga has ended.,2
"Look at those plump breasts, that could lead you to some suckcess: cause when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and those big boobs in my face I get SPRUNG! (Take it away reply guy, do a verse)",1
I can reference all day.,3
"Do you think you ll be able to build up to another Endgame-like event, given 10 more years of build up? Or was this more of a once-in-a-lifetime type of thing?",1
"It's not that it's just like asking for there to be a 200 million dollar WB small ville and christopher nolan batman crossover, theyre different formats, it wouldnt feel right and it's a juvenile idea",0
Oh thank god,2
First of all. That s cheating second of all. OMG your son is so adorable. I love him and he is mind now,3
"If it's done right, no one would even notice I have faith in the Marvel crew and I'm I sure am eager to forget the Fox-Men.",3
"Hey Good Bot,Do you think Ultron deserved to die?",1
What do you mean by  considering they really shouldn't have the IP in the first place ?,1
It still irks me that they can't make everyone face the same direction :(,3
"No metal hand, though I suppose that could be CGI'd out. ",1
Wasn t the original scene going to include Captain Marvel attacking Thanos and his goons before they got to Natasha and Clint.  I remember seeing BTS footage of Brie Larson on set in costume,1
"In addition to this Captain Marvel scene, I am actually also very curious about the set of scenes where Quicksilver doesn't die and is also in this scene.",1
How different would the MCU be if you had the rights to all the characters from the beginning?,1
Endgame 2: Electric Boogaloo ,2
I didn't see it? Help.,1
And Howard Stark but we always knew he loved Tony.,2
They tried. A lot. There s a gif of it somewhere.,2
A Captain Marvel remake?,1
**visible concusion**,1
"Yeah, real life aside for a moment (being kept in the dark while filming) - Parker has gone from a kid in highschool to another end of the galaxy in no time.  He is by far the least experienced hero in A:IW (as well as the youngest other than technically Groot). And he's up against a threat bigger than any of his more seasoned peers have ever faced.",3
It's only 6 months away,1
"Hi Kevin! Two questions: What differences do you think have allowed the MCU to flourish compared to other franchises that have tried to build universes? You've used many  comic book  concepts, like time travel and the microverse. Are there any other concepts (multiverse, etc.) That you would like to put on screen?",1
"God damn, Cap vs Thanos. Wasnt this in the original comic?",1
"Fair point, I d agree with you that it should take place in space again, but there s a small country with Asgardians on Earth, so they ll have to get involved as well.",2
"I still badly want an Agent Carter revival on Disney+, but that's never going to happen. More than likely, they'll wrap up the loose ends from the show is Season 7 of AoS and then be done with the character overall.",1
Hopefully. I just pray he can be gracious about this. He's seemed pretty touchy lately,1
"When you get an F on you final exam, but you get the extra credit question.",1
Windows Instructions?,1
The hype is real when we technically know at least some of the snapped come back and survive and it s STILL super stressful. April is so far away ,1
"I would love to see Sam Alexander come to the big screen. As a Mexican, I would love to see a lead Latino superhero in the MCU  since the only Latino characters in the MCU are Luis from Ant-Man and Ajak in Eternals.  However, I have to admit that I haven t read any Nova comics yet  therefore I don t think I have enough information to properly answer the question. Are there any comic runs that you would recommend?",0
He's smart and uses angles or some shit.,3
Thor v Adam Warlock going to be epic in GOTG3,2
So is Loki going to be executed by proxima? Hope not. ,1
" We're in the Endgame now  - Dr. Strange. x200B After Infinity War, with people holding on to their seats at the end, they needed a title that would still keep that anxiety going. Not Avengers: Happy Ending.",1
Same here! And I sat up and leaned forward over my phone. I wasn t ready. ,2
He was between Pepper and Rhodey since he had just talked to Tony,2
Man I would pay for this scene,1
Levin haha,1
"You know, at the end there, when Thor sizes CM up, I bet he flashes glowy eyes at her, and she responds with the same, which is what illicits his approval",0
"You always said that you wanted to do something different for the last movie of a trilogy (great job with Thor Ragnarok).  Is Marvel Studios planning on doing something different/crazier in the 3rd Ant-Man movie. Maybe a different director, different take on the character, bigger scope?",2
I actually did not learn the title till the end of the trailer. Great job reddit/Marvel,1
Disney owns the characters. Netflix owns the show. Disney wants to make their own show or have DD for the MCU. Disney takes their character for their in house stuff but Netflix has the show for their streaming service. Please redirect your attention to the entirety of the Spectacular Spider-Man for more information.,3
**EVERYBODY STAY CALM!!!!**,3
My phone did. I don t proof read often on Reddit.,2
WHAT ?!!,1
I always though hulk punching a leviathan was badass but Scotty 2 Hottie one upped him big time.,1
Shadowcat. There was a recent-ish comic line of starlord and kitty pride,3
Thor moves the hammer all the time for unworthy reasons. That's not how this works.,3
"> They both look just like this in the trailer. Just to make sure we are talking about Endgame, right? (url)",1
"Oh, I actually was a big fan of the movie. I am also a big fan of Alita too. Maybe something is to be said about me and my like of female action stars?",1
I kinda wanna see how they do in each roles,3
Lol this is a huge stretch he's talking about the ideological horror of superhumans,2
"OMG, this is so sad to hear. My prayers bro ",3
Do I really need to phrase PRACTICAL LOOKING?,1
Portals is some of the movie!,1
"I am so fucking sad right now. I've never been affected by a celebrity death like this. I never met him in real life, I have no relation to him, and yet he feels like such a big part of my life. Condolences for his family, hope they are all ok. ",1
"Absolutely loved this ride from iron man to endgame!! Honestly the MCU opened my world up to the world of comics and to a greater extent, Sci-fi! Really looking forward to phase 2 and hopefully it s as enjoyable!",1
" The movie will start, and it will end. ",1
She is according to IMDb. I thought that was established,1
Groot looks still quite young at the end?,1
"Today is now even more meaningful to me as it is my first day ever working in the film industry at Pinewood Studios, where Marvel calls home for so many films he inspired. I waited and hoped for so long that I would make it here someday...and here I am, tearing up in a place where his spirit can most certainly be felt. Thank you, Stan. I most likely wouldn't be here without you. ",3
During this scene everyone was clapping in the theater.  I m not judging but it was kinda weird. I ve never been in a movie and had people clapping mid-movie,1
holy fuck cap,3
Will Maestro appear in the MCU,1
Shuri has all of her ridiculous inventions derive from a meteor that happened to crash into where she lived. Tony had to discover an entirely new element and created an arc reactor in 7 days while trapped in a cave with terrorists. That 16 year old girl better not get the big head.,3
That scene is straight outta the pages of a comic book,1
"Great, now I want Thanos in Mortal Kombat.",3
Omg now I want that character in the next Spider-Man movie,1
 Get me Spiderman! ,1
Any plans on doing Howard the Duck justice with his own film?,1
"I'm cancer free, so pretty well I guess",2
Cue Fanboys overreacting,3
"Judging by their first movies, I would never in a million years guess Thor would be the one to get 4 movies.",1
He was literally next to Antman,1
What if? : thanos got his farming movie,1
Doubting the mouse is a risky move.,1
C'mon guys where are the GIFs?,1
"Maybe it varies by where you live, but I m in the greater Austin area, so I asked to list theaters near me, then I clicked the date (Thur), picked my theater, showtime, and reserved my seats.  Fandango.com/InfinityWar",2
We love you 3000 alexander,1
Did you know?,1
David Harbour as Ben Grimm. It's a huge waste that he'll probably play a one-and-done character.,2
So the wait for the trailer is finally over....And now I can't wait to see  the movie... Good job marvel ,1
1stOnRt1! I've traveled from 28 minutes into the future to tell you that you were wrong!,1
I CAN FEEL THE REDRINKING.,1
"I hope not. I'm not about that. But hey, its Disney. They're... weird about this stuff. And RDJ did drugs, he never joked about raping children. I dunno. If they had fired RDJ, I think it'd suck but I would understand. ",2
*America s* post!,1
Ouch my heart. Rest In Peace Stan Lee. I currently want to be snapped again just to not feel the pain of your loss. Spider-Man has always had a special place in my heart and I thank you for bringing to life so many amazing characters. ,1
What is your favorite song/piece of music hitherto unused in the MCU movies? Any chance of incorporating this song?,1
"I definitely like what I see here. It's certainly a very somber trailer, probably more so than any other MCU trailer before it. Overall, I'm very excited to see what this film brings to the table and how they're going to resolve this entire Infinity War saga next year.",1
"The  random guys  also have said that the three smartest in MCU are Rocket, Banner and Stark. Since it was quoted in the context of Endgame, I'm assuming this to refer as the smartest among those who were present since the dusted didn't contribute in the creation of the 'Iron gauntlet' or the time machine.",2
L-R   Taskmaster  Black Widow  Zemo  US Agent Moonstone  Blonsky/Rulk  Hammer  Ghost,2
How come it was decided that Anthony Mackie/Sam Wilson (Falcon) would inherit the mantle of Captain America over Sebastian Stan/Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier)?,3

Well I hope that you have a good rest of your day!,1
"She looks awesome, and I m not just saying that because she s pretty. I m stoked she s back. :D",2
"Hello Kevin! Is there any possibility or plans in future for another huge cinematic experience just like Endgame, having almost all the characters, possibly with a mega event plot which will require some of the original X-Men cast, Deadpool, original Avengers' cast, and other currently existing and yet to appear Marvel characters?",2
It's just cowboy (ungendered) boots. Ain't nothing male or female about it.,1
"I grew up on marvel, seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 12, and seeing every other marvel movie in theaters within a week of release. That brought me to tears man.... good fucking work",1
Did he just drive a gas guzzling van coast to coast ?,1
"His goal was only to wipe out half. Death brought him back to life to act as her agent in correcting this perceived  imbalance  in life and death. It uh, goes South from there.",3

JJJ  >  DJT,0
 Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries (url),2
relax dude no one's bullying her or anything. It's just a game.,3
"So? My narrative above is about the theoretical situation if Hulk swallowed the Tesseract and how Thanos would go about getting it. I m aware that he only has the power stone before the space stone, that is what is implied in the narrative.",1
"Forget my last comment. What I am trying to say is that they traveled to the already stablished timeline multiple times through out Endgame, if they couldn t there s no way they could travel back their original timeline either. When 2012 arrives in that timeline there are gonna be 3 Captain America s before one returns to 2023. I am sure Loki and Doctor Strange into the Multiverse of Madness will explain it better. They could choose where to go in that specify timeline.",0
 Dumb opinions get down voted. Sorry. ,2
"They went with  Ultimato  in Brazil, and that's the name Ultimatum got over here lol",3
I'm happy for you. Well done to Disney for reaching out but also shout out to /u/Tinoh for the initial offer of their ticket to the cast and crew screening.,1
That's on Earth dipshit.,3
I m shivering cos of the excitement !!!!,1
As opposed to claiming he's faking it... After??? Maybe it's just tasteless regardless?,3
> with no end in sight People thought that about westerns. Now you can't remember the last time you saw one.  Everything has it's day. This is the day of the Super Hero movie. It will pass. Something new will come along and people will hate that.  Something will come after that and James Gunn will be tweeting how this new new thing is pure crappolla. The circle will continue.,3
I think this captures my feelings just fine.  https://youtu.be/nStEvyBDNgo,1
Very well done.  Love the lighting you used in the photo as well,2
"Hi Kevin! I'm an aspiring filmmaker, in terms of writing, acting, producing, and directing. Since you've produced so many successful films, both critically and commercially, I'd like to know - how hard is it to break into the film business?",1
Learned a lot while he was in prison!,3
"oh, oh shit I guess you did!",1
Definition shouldn't affect exposure though,3
Gutter is a fucking legend.,1
Just like he nailed Spidey to the ground :'(,1
"Thanks! Interesting, although it's quite explicitly only movies made by Chinese companies in the article, not international films",2
"Sorry, yes, I did know that - I was typing too hastily.  I was simply trying to get across that the idea of releasing a film with obviously reduced quality (compressed dynamic range, over/under brightened scenes, etc...) was ridiculous as a possible  solution  when the problem isn't the movie quality, it's the user's viewing equipment/environment.",1
almost like an  end credits scene  of the infinity saga and phase 3,1
If Marvel is responsible for bringing him in the MCU in a proper way sure why not. We've all been waiting for a proper Spider-Man vs Venom for years so.,1
Anyone else getting weird ass vibes from cap?,1
Always half. Always,1
There we go ,1
Thor was there and could have done what she did five seconds later had she not shown up. Her appearance did not fill some false need created by the writers. She just showed up to help and that's what she did. That's all I'm saying.,0
Endgame is a misspelling. Can't believe they didn't catch that.  4vengers: Edamame ,2
"No it's not, you're being deliberately argumentative without having an argument. ",1
"I think Spielberg actually has said he likes the Guardians movies, so that'll be shocking.",1
"Wow! Mr. Feige himself! This is awesome! So obviously, the new Disney+ shows are going to be more closely tied to the movies than the previous shows. Is it possible, going forward, that characters and events from the existing shows might have their own impact on the movies? Seeing James D Arcy in Endgame was a real treat, and we d love to see more like that.",1
So what is the part about Marvel licensing the Spider-man rights to Sony for two decades? Does that mean he will be given back to Marvel in the next few years anyway?,1
This wouldn't do anything though. If anything it's like 5 minutes longer. A lot of dumb shit could've been cut out.,0
When the acquisition of Fox is complete it'll be something like 40  of all major Movie and TV releases that are at least partially controlled by ye olde House of Mouse.,3
"That was awful but the worst offender for me was Korg's joke about Asgard blowing up. By that point in the film I was already so done and that final joke was like an insult. The constant jokes were honestly just grating and tiring. I don't know why Taika felt he couldn't have any serious moments. Everything had to be undecut by a joke. Although that's most Marvel movies, which has kind of turned me off of them recently.",3
Holy shit thank you,1
"No you're ok. The Make-A-Wish foundation is a company that will come to families of children who are battling cancer, (in my case leukemia) and will grant you a  wish  my wish was to meet tom holland and visit the set of spiderman far from home. It doesnt have to be meeting a celebrity though. You could go on a cruise or a shopping spree or whatever.",3
I noticed that Star Wars was a bit lighter as well. Was able to see Vader s eyes in almost all of his scenes in ANH and was able to see a lot of other details that I imagine were supposed to stay hidden by the lighting.,1
Leaning only one direction makes you the worst type of person. The left is just as bad as you re right. But keep telling yourself that your views are the right views bc you are the reason for a divide.,1
He probably spoiled far from home for them too.,1
Cool! Let's ignore all those rapey inconvenient things right after our most feminist movie is released! YAY!,0
I actually didn't read that ( yet? ). What was it like?,1
What if it was snapped?,1
"True. Me too, he d be a great evil scientist at least of some sort. ",1
Exactly! It's why it annoys me when people are like  just fucking Google it  if you're trying to have a discussion with someone.,1
Literally nothing would ever beat Gone with the Wind if you don't adjust for inflation,1
Well why would any kid want to be Starlord? That guy is one sandwich away from being fat,3
"Kevin I'm just wondering if you watch Game of Thrones on HBO, and if you do, what are your thoughts on season 8?",1
"Yep. I'm the last guy to come to the defense of anything about the foX-Men movies, but they nailed the look and placement of the claws.",2
Well deserved!,3
I think i'm gonna cry when I see the X-Men trailer,1
How long till this poster is being sold by some dodgy Facebook page...,1
"Na, I don't buy it",1
Yo I thought the same?? It s as if he was doing the whole acting thing to get an in at the music industry,2

So good. Only thing that would ve improved it was a surprise reemergence of  Immigrant Song ,0

And then kills everybody so we have deadkills kills the marvel CINEMATIC universe,1
"That's cool, I didn't know that",1
"I think it s more of an instance of Thanos not putting a lot of effort in initially and Cap was able to meet him with enough force to halt him but when Thanos inevitably re-exerts himself he ll fling Cap. It s like when you try opening a door that is heavier than you expected. Yeah, the door might have stopped you but not because you can t open it, you just got surprised that it requires more than zero effort to push. ",3
I don't actually care that Netflix cancelled Iron Fist and Luke Cage but cancelling Daredevil? What a stupid decision tbh.,1
"Apart from  **Gyllenhaal**  I don't know, or care who any of those people are.",0

Oh man. That s what I want so bad. A freaking OLED TV. Right now I have a toddler running around lol. So that will be on the back burner for awhile.,1
"Agreed, but I'm more concerned about who gets cast in the role. Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. If they mess this up, they're screwed.",1
Was the weapon Thor summoned at the end an Axe or a Hammer,1
"Which is great, but what's annoying for them is, if it's all one continuity, then people new to the franchise might need to slog through all the garbage films for context. ",2

I'm hoping you do get your early screening.  But remember...  you're not allowed to leave us before your gold   platinum run out!  -)  Peace in your heart my friend. ,2
I was kinda looking forward to it but the trailer is bland as hell..,3
HNNNNNGGGGG,1
Thanos is like a starfish and the one who's head was chopped off in 2018 will come back as two Thanoses and they'll ride around on a floating teeter totter going back n forth perfectly balanced.,3

"From the wife side, I hope my husband goes first. He's lost a lot of people and it's really hurt him. It'll crush me when he dies but I think I'll be able to handle it better than he can. Unless we have kids, then that might give him enough strength to carry on. ",3
Great atmosphere. Not showing too much. Great first trailer. I m in ,1
"Welp, I assumed this was gonna just be about the actual trailer and I wouldn't get spoiled for the leaked one. Oh well :(",2
Not to mention the focus on the cosmic stuff.,3
Ya fair comment. Def going to hit it up. Figured /r/marvelstudios would talk me into it haha,2
I'm sad that you're such a dumbass.,1
"Hi Kevin, thanks for what you've given us over the last 11 years. We can't wait to see where this universe goes in Phase 4 and beyond. My question for you concerns Carol Danvers. So far, she seems pretty much unstoppable. Will her future appearances introduce any weaknesses to her power?",1
"See, I m not so sure about that, I think after the first few, they realized their movies have 2 significantly different levels. One for children and people who just general enjoy these kind of movies, and for die hard marvel fans. ",1
Any chance of Deadpool entering the Mcu with the other characters!? Even if it s just a small cameo of sorts,1

Shooting at Pinewood is not an indication the story takes them to England.  Reasons for going there might be financial or logistical.,2

Dude fought Thanos with butterflies. Dr. Strange is my favorite.,1
She told me her pitch and that she wasn't chosen but I have my fingers crossed she will land one down the line. She's the funniest writer I know.,2
"Not going out without a fight, I like it. I hope your wish will be granted. You sure have my upvote. ",1
"But they didn't make it that way. There is no hint whatsoever of Thanos going anywhere except for 2023. They could've made it that. But they didn't. It was a specific, conscious choice on the part of the filmmakers. It wasn't in the movie  it became a deleted scene...AKA non-canon. Regarding Thanos' comment...he discovered the Avengers when Loki was defeated in the Battle of New York.",3
"Valkyrie, Pepper, Happy, Wong",1
 dont know why this popped up on my phone. Btw only intrested in getting an intevew with Murdoc Niccals and not Marvel,0
So this was a big issue to me. I just wished they showed us it won't work because the limb being cut seemed like a foreshadow.,1
The most necessary answer of them all,2
You forgot Steve Rogers. I mean it was disappointing how emotionless he managed to come across in Civil War of all movies.    Or maybe he just wasn t overacting hah...,1
Blockbuster movies as big as this one would definitely catch something that glaring. There is an insane amount of detail put into every character's appearance.,3
"Holy fuck, you can really see Brolin s face through Thanos. He really was a perfect casting choice. His voice is just so haunting and powerful. ",1

Will we be learning about Marvel s 4th phase at comic-con??,1
happy cake day!,1
But she is also way too young for the Avengers.  Thor is over a thousand.  Captain America was over a hundred and must be pushing 170 now.   I think they will do a Young Avengers movie and then have them meet the Runaways.  The third movie would then be them plus the group with Ms. Marvel and Ironheart.  That might lead directly into Secret Wars.,1
"I'm pretty sure she actually shot a scene for Endgame, but it got cut. It was with Rocket I believe.",3
damn tom holland is short,1
"Poor Thors head getting squeezed like a grape. I can see how that scene plays out. Thor defending himself while Loki submitting and handing over the Tesseract. But also the black order surrounding Loki has me thinking maybe, just maybe, it was Loki and Thor defending themselves against Thanos and they just overpowered them.",1

This is what I think Reddit is good form. Yea there are a lot of young  punk  kids trolling or doing whatever it is kids do today. But there is also a lot of them getting great pieces of advice from older users. Not only that but since it s anonymous and online I feel like it easier for the kid to let their guard down and actually listen to people  that will actually help them mature and grow ahead of their peers in a way they couldn t have without Reddit. ,1
"No, you didn't say it. I took a guess at your meaning because your tone was clearly critical. Seemed like you were painting the creators as somehow lazy or incompetent. Were you not?",1
I thought it made zero sense but I feel like people just didn t want the movie to end so they wanted as many scenes in the movie as possible.,2
You start the next arch of course,1

Hey Kevin. Do you remember when RDJ said there would be an Iron Man 4 on The Ellen Show? Were there actual plans for one or was he just messing with the audience?,1
God will they just release the second trailer already,1
"Yeah, and what I'm saying that the interpretation and commentary has no evidence. And so comes across as overwrought and bathetic. ",2
"Well, did he answer the question while meeting your parameters? Doesn't look like it. Did he reveal much of anything here that we weren't already aware of? Not really. Just the  Yes  to the Ten Rings and  real  Mandarin question.",1
"I do realize that, But do realize that good usage of Occam's razor is the trait of a rational person. I'm trying to get you to understand there is in all likelihood there is no vast conspiracy against you. It's just other people holding a different stance than yourself. stop being so paranoid. ",1
I am shocked in the best way possible. Amazing.  ,1
"Look at Ronin, tell me that isn t the face of a man who lost EVERYTHING. Yep 500  sure they are following the story and his whole family died. ",1
These posts go well with the comments on all the other Spider-man posts about how people want to see *constant* shout-outs to Oscorp and the Sinister Six and all the shite that Sony will absolutely jam down our throats the second the Feige leash is off.,1
"Omg!!! Thank you so much for this!!! Is this really the last we see of Chris Evans as Captain America? We need more of America s Ass. Also, is there a chance for a Daisy Johnson cameo in any of the films?? From my husband: Can we know what kind of spell Dr. Strange used in Endgame with the water? Edit: added a question",1
"Yep, that sums up Tom perfectly. Mark Ruffalo gives him a run for his money for revealing secrets.",1
"They can reference characters who actually exist in the comics IIRC, like when Jameson was trying to name Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2 and when someone suggested  Doctor Strange  he said  I like it...but it's taken! ",3

They didn t just flip the colours in post. She wore her suit from Captain Marvel for the majority of filming Emdgame and CGI d it throughout,1
where is r/PunPatrol on this,1
YouTube got snapped !!,1
I would personally go for Joe Keery (Steve from Stranger Things) as Johnny.  Zac is a bit too old for the role in my opinion.,3
I really hope they leave out Captain Marvel and address the  in memory of Stan Lee  at the end of Avenger 4 instead. It would be the most fitting.,1
It's already pretty much done and in the can. I guess maybe they have to still edit it and/or add special effects but overall the show is done and over with months ago when they finished filming.,0

I wanted to ask about a lot of stuff, soft reboot of Inhumans, Heroes for Hire, but i really really want to ask one thing.  Have you or anyone on Marvel considered a She-Hulk tv series? Disney+ seems like the perfect platform for that. Or is Universal an obstacle for that?  Thanks for reading this, love all you have done for everyone.",2

You can see in that shot with the missing posters that this is probably when he has returned, and he has no idea WTF has happened.

"I think that Professor Hulk was necessary in order to wield the Infinity Gauntlet and bring everyone back. Banner couldn't have done it on his own because his body would crumble before he could snap and Hulk couldn't have done it on his own because he lacks the intelligence necessary to carry out a task such as bringing half of all life back into existence. If Professor Hulk wasn't created, everyone couldn't have been brought back without some kind of sacrifice.",3

And they made him fat and depressed in Endgame just so he wouldn't kick too much ass against Thanos with no gauntlet.

I knew him more than RDJ who hadn t been in a big movie I can recall for a pretty long time before Iron Man (maybe Zodiac, but that wasn t really hitting the same audience). So I definitely wouldn t call him a C lister. And like everyone s said, an Oscar winning actress is also probably not a C lister either.",2
"I mean, do you think the guy in the thirty seven hundred dollar suit is just gonna serve the First Order faithfully? COME ON ",3
Very possible that it is negligible but as long as we can agree it exists. Many people who are feeling it must now make the decision if they will continue to watch after this  end  in the MCU and that's a legitimate decision,1
Great news!,1

"That s not what he s saying like at all? He s not a child who doesn t understand how to treat people.  He works in an industry full of narcissistic and egotistical people, and that he s happy having someone like RDJ who is a humble person in that awful industry. that he can look up to and try to achieve the same thing that his role model has.

"He said he wasn't going to watch the trailer yet, and to let the comments build hype for him. So of course, Reddit decided to try to disappoint him by leaving negative comments",1
Heyyy Happy is alive!! Wooohoo,3
"Movies don't have to ape reality. Especially ones with so many fantasy elements. These heroes should inspire us, not makes us feel like,  oh well, shit happens .",1
wasnt the other one?,1

I can feel the rematch!,3
"first off i just want to thank you for everything you ve done to create such an enriching and amazing universe how did you go about pitching such a complicated and large universe to executives or was the extent of the scale not originally part of the plan? another question  since the story and the plan is pretty well established and planned, how much creative freedom is each individual director of each movie given on their respective projects?",1
Some might say...amazing.,3
"Hey Kevin,  was killing off Tony Stark something that's been on the table for a while? or was is something you decided on as Infinity War started productions. Also how did you end up choosing Tony Stark, out of all the other characters who seem to be more capable of wielding the Gauntlet.",1

Amazing bro,1
i take it you haven't seen FFH yet?,1
"With all the hard work you've put in making the MCU a reality, and a successful one at that, has the hardest challenge been keeping Tom Holland from leaking spoilers?",1
Please put a ban on /u/meanspiritedanddumb receiving any reddit awards. Thanks.,0
" We re heroes now. What do we do? Punch and fall, boys. Punch .... and fall. ( And if you find something, throw it )",1
I meant it in the realm of children's films where characters don't have to be dynamic or rounded or complex. Much like most  good Vs bad + supernatural  narratives,0
He/She even turned the Sony logo in the last frame. Dedication.,3
You should be working for their marketing department...,1
Her at the end all powered up? YESSSSS,1
"Ha yeah, totally forgot about this post. So many balls in the air for this movie, I bet few people got very close tbf. I ll claim that shred of victory though lol",1
makes sense,1
TONY IS BACK WITH THE CREW  ,1
It's a bit like disrespect to religion. Otherwise it looks nice.,0
Hey Mr. Feige can I go to the far from home premiere? Now the actual question. How challenging did you and your screen writers find it to connect story lines without having made certain movies yet in the timeline.?,2
I thought swords was his thing?,1
"Man, fuck this. 20+ movies in the making shouldn't count! at least avatar will take it back when they re release it in a bit.",0
Those last two Planet of the Apes movies were a really pleasant surprise. I wasn't expecting much but they're a couple of my favourites,1
"Same, I think a mix of the two would be cool because she needs at least some armor or padding.",1
"No, cause... he's not wearing it?",1
"Hey Kevin! Random question, but can bananas fly? Thanks!",1
I m pretty sure her hair changes throughout the entire trailer.,1
Sony: but i'm nothing without Spider-Man! Marvel: if you're nothing without Spider-Man you shouldn't have it,1
"Movies whose main purpose is not to entertain the four quadrants of walets, I mean people.",0
It's probably going to be retcon anyway once Marvel decided to include him in one of Eternals sequel.,1
I m still happy that Captain Marvel got less screen time than Black Widow s sandwich.,0
Batman,1
"I mean it doesn t make any sense, but it s fun.",1
That's a madeup word,1
"I'm an asshole, not the guy judging people solely for watching TV shows he doesn't like. K.  And no I don't give a shit about the Kardashians, I just think this guy's shallow as hell",0
Checkered shirts never went away.,3
Why can't he just make everyone 10 times smaller so they require less resources,1
Everyone got snapped. Boom done. No changes. Also works statistically,1
"I couldn t cry. I was just straight up in complete awe. No emotions, just a heightened sense of awareness taking all these things in. Something only a true movie going experience can illicit. This is why I go to see movies like this in the theater still. Fuck yes.",2
Shoutout to Brolin for being an awesome villain.,1

Garry!,3
"They would have failed a basic language course, but I support your opinion to defend that. Just realize that shit only changes because stupid and/or uneducated people outnumber the intelligent ones.",3
Let's cut to the chase: what's on the docket?,1
I just watched it My heart is fucking racing oh my god,1
Nah it was Surtur saying  Odin is not on Asgard  and generally just Loki acting very un-Odin-like.,3
"I am fairly certain Russos confirmed it in an interview that tony did not kill thanos, just sent the whole army back.",0
"I have nothing to offer you except the fact that I wish you nothing but the very best in everything you experience. You've been humble, polite, open, and you need to realize that people are pulling for you because of who you are. You're a great person and people care about you. Continue being you... continue being awesome. ",1
They're the guy who keeps the money men hard while making sure the actors don't get fucked.,1
I don't know why you're acting like they were offeneded,0
I meant it in context to Cap Holding Thanos' hand.,1
"He truly changed the world for geeks and nerds for the better. Back in the day kids were getting stuffed in lockers for reading comics, now comic book heroes are actually cool.",1
 Cause I don t know what imma do if it doesn t  holyyyyyyy I had tears and chills by this point.   Cap,1
Its really comparing apples and oranges though,3
Excelsior.  Rest in peace Mr Lee,1
if I live a life like that I know I'd die happy,1
I vow to never see another spiderman in the theater as long and it's made by Sony,1
I got some bad news pal,1
*silently screaming as I watch the trailer* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,1
"Hi Kevin, If you could give advice to a young film student, what would it be? Also, thank you for the memories. I ve been on this rollercoaster of cinema since I was eight and now I m a college student. These movies are part of the reason I m doing what I m doing.",1
"That's just not true though. Yes, a lot of Marvel comics keep it kid friendly, but not all. Moon Knight, Deadpool, Wolverine, Punisher, Daredevil all have very adult storylines that would be considered R rated.",1
Listen to the Tropic Thunder commentary,1
"Looks pretty cool, Thanos looks weird as fuck though.",1
Pick me up on Friday!,1
THE WHORE IS PREGNANT!,3
Oh that s right I forgot they want to kill off their 20 billion dollar cash cow and cancel all the upcoming movies because: reasons ,1
"You're almost there little dude, try and connect that last neuron",2
I never realized how much I wish he had an Antzord like a Hulkbuster suit till now,1
Not to ruin this too much but if it wasn't for his daughter being at risk I doubt Tony sacrifices himself to kill Thanos. Just happens the greater good goes along with keeping his family safe.,3
I dunno. I feel like cosplay is what you choose to make it. It s nice to see people getting involved with the festivities. I won t fault someone because they feel intimidated to do full on Battle Thor. I ve seen some really impressive Lebowski Thors.,3
Why show tony stark in space then he s with the team 1 minute later lmao ,1
"That's kind of stupid isn't it, Thanos can do whatever he wants, why would he chose to double snap some planets?",1
Jed Mosley,1
"I feel your pain, I need to have heart surgery before the end of the month or I might not make it to April myself. Spread the word far and wide and the community can do it's best to make it go viral. They aren't heartless at Marvel and if you get some national exposure they will make it happen. Best of luck man.",3
"> I think seeing Tilda in Endgame was the best cameo of the movie for me, really did not expect to see her again and she is amazing in everything she does I also really enjoyed that she helped in the 2012 fight a little bit by shooting down aliens from her building",1
"Coppola has way more klunkers than, say, Kubrick. I d say every Kubrick since 1955 is a gem except for the Tom Cruise one. Coppola is mostly klunkers. Ever try to watch Tetro? However Apocalypse Now and The Conversation are quite important even if not hits. Even Fellini has films that I wouldn t watch twice, however they are few. The only director who I would say never made a klunker is Godard. I d watch anything by him any time.",3
"> Funny how I've had DMs and comments trying to spoil Endgame. Sorry boys I've already seen the movie twice, try harder x People are fucking horrible. Glad they didn't get you!",1
"Damn, iron man just got bodied so hard",1
Just like Bart ,1

I always said he would be perfect for playing the Riddler,3
"Exclusivity, craftsmanship, classism, and a free market. ",1
"Couldn't agree more. They'll lose their uniqueness. They really need to start making them different asap. Most of them, at the moment, have the same constant humour, ugly grey colour palette and some sort of chase scene. In the future many movies should vary in tone, cinematography and colour grading can reflect that. For instance, Spidey having swift and fluid action sequences to match with how acrobatic and vibrant he is.",0
So it could actually be called Thor four more thor,1
"What are your opinions on moon knight, would love to see him in the mcu",1

it could work but Magneto would have to be old af even if hes a mutant,2

Best news all day! He s so talented  ,1
Yes but cap doesn t want that,2
Went in wong,2
Thanos moves to Hawkeye's farm.,1
I love all 3 of the Iron Man movies.  I also love AoU.,1
"What does black widows hope to accomplish with that target practice? She witnessed the winter soldier go at Thanos with a giant machine gun that possibly had vibranium bullets and it did nothing. Even with a headshot, a pistol will only tickle Lord Thanos",0
Isn t it 3/4 though. He half s the population once then halves the remaining in the snap so the surviving Asgardians of Ragnorok lost 75  of their population,3
"*discovers Miracle Grow, drops to his knees running his hands through the fertilizer, yells to the sky*  I didn't know!  ",3

The hardest decisions require the weakest maths. ,3
Thread is moving so fast no one will see me say that I wish them a great day,3
Love seeing the Darkhold from Agents of Shield in that scene with Nico lying down in the pentagram. Morgan must have found it in Hell... right where Robbie Reyes left it.  itsallconnected,3
Does anyone else hear Ultron at the end? I could be wrong but it sounds like him.,0
Bruh 2 miles from me..,1
What a bunch of a-holes.,1
"Will characters from the Disney plus streaming shows  (Wanda,vision,Loki,Hawkeye,falcon,winter soldier) appear in future mcu movies ?",1
"We ll see. If that s the case will the actors signing this letter face a backlash? I doubt it. Anything s possible of course, I just don t see it. Now if they d said something racist or the like the. It d be game over for any involved.",0
>Scorsese I genuinely dont. Dude doesnt have one movie with a decent female character. Lets keep him far away from the mcu.,2
This is awesome! I want your superpower!,1
I'm glad he at least got to know the story.,1
"Hand to hand, except the opponent got 2 more hands",1
Oligopoly then? /s,1
"Because the so-called Emperor is a coward! That's right, I said coward! Oh yes! He agreed to banish the worship of Talos at the tip of an Aldmeri sword. They called it the 'White-Gold Concordat.' Well, I call it blasphemy! A true son of the Empire would never have turned his back on our greatest hero, not at any price. Well, let me tell you something, friend. Cyrodiil is a long way from here, and in Skyrim, we will never forsake mighty Talos!",1
*laughs in IronFist*,1
imagine the callbacks to the previous films,1
I am suprised to see that opinion here in a Marvel sub.,2
"Yeah, I can see why this scene got cut. Seems pretty forced, and we get all the same emotions out of the scene with everyone at the funeral.",0
Supposedly  1 billion between this and Avengers 4,1
Thanos gets the Avengers out in the middle of nowhere with some dude they barely know.....what are they gonna do say no?,2
This is the first thing I noticed. Somebody dies and I don't want it to be anybody at all. This is going to break me.,1
"So I had a idea that would be a cute/goofy  moment in this movie. So since Starlord has been away from earth for so long  when he gets back to earth he may have some culture shock or need to get caught up on pop culture, a cute way to do this would be for cap to give starlord his list or, switch to a scene of them catching up together.",1
Damn great question,1
"Yup, definitely not for me.   I'll watch some Eddie Murphy if I  need  jokes, haha ",1
"Ah man, you asphalt workers are crazy. I've been doing concrete form work the last few years, but I only managed to last one day doing asphalt.",1

Rolls? Are you really that attached to your dinner rolls dude? Discriminating against wheat?,2
That's more than three,1

"Rhodey is a fucking Air Force Colonel with tons of experiences in battle. Rhodes is like 10,000x's smarter than Hulk",1
looks like after his gem gets taken he gets to get with Wanda Maximoff... so maybe she's founding his dations,1
"Hi Mr. Feige. I'm a massive fan of what you guys have built at Marvel Studios. I was wondering if you could confirm or deny a cameo I thought I spotted in Endgame. In Cap's support group, I was pretty sure I spotted Elden Henson sitting next to Jim Starlin, but I've never seen anything one way or the other confirming who it was. Was that him, or just someone who resembled him? Thanks for everything you guys do over there!",1
I thought it was Tony Stark In Space?,1
oh yeah cause its gonna be the exact same  scenario,1
14 people payed good money to give gold just snap again please,1
I want an open source spider man so that this suit doesn t happen again,1
I'm sure he'll be in it... I don't think people would be happy about a thor-less thor 4. Perhaps he's off with the guardians and she defends asgard? He losses his worthiness and has to reearn it while she fills in (this is what happened in the comics). Or maybe they're a Thor duo together...in Endgame they show that two people can use the hammers at once. They said valkyrie is looking for a queen...im guessing that will probably be Jane Foster Thor.,1
"How awkward was it to pretend that Black Panther was the first black Marvel superhero, knowing that Blade exists?",1

Marvel.com has never wavered in stating the shows as part of the MCU, from the press releases to casting announcements to just regular articles.

"Yeah, like cancer research! Fuck cancer research!",0
Where is Captain Marvel??? She was supposed to be Important PART of the movie. I love and adorw the trailer but hate this. Atleast give her some spotlight like Black Panther. ,1
"Uhh, I'm a reporter that's why, also notice how he doesn't wear glasses?  I wonder what's that's like, I wear glasses",1
"This trailer just score YouTube record for most liked MCU trailer of all time. And did it just under two hours.   AoU 81M views and 528K likes and this have 540k.. And soon, it should surpassed most liked trailer ever: The Last Jedi with 703K likes..",1

Anything under 44 minutes? Isn't that very easy to circumvent? Wonder how they worded that.,2
"It's not a phase, Dad!",2
"I was wrong, not an oxymoron in this case. I was thinking of  'reporting *as* entertainment' (like TMZ), and not 'reporting *on* entertainment' (like this site seems to do) as the other commenter put it so well.",1
"So you re literally saying here the reason they don t wear helmets is because of their aesthetic But with Cap, his helmet isn t about the aesthetic? Edit- you made my argument for me and I can t wait to see how you backtrack and continue to act like I m the moron in this situation when you keep making points that don t lead anywhere or just help build my case",0
Many people would be upset about that i'll tell ya right now lol,3
Thanks! Actually you can make yours if you want! I made this as a tutorial for my YouTube channel (Link in the comments above),1
I agree he should be rehired but he didn't give the same courtesy to Roseanne.,1
It is legitimately bizarre.  Scorsese looks sane by comparison.  If you don't want to call lighthearted action comedy movies  cinema  then go ahead... but  despicable ?  What is he talking about?,3
"> Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes, so as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold.

In Kevin we trust! When you first started MCU did you think it will get to where it is today? I still remember going to theater after Spanish class in high school to watch the first Ironman  . What memories takes you back when you think about the inception of MCU?,1
Awesome. Comic fans:1  Internet Nazis: 0,1

"I didn't think the comments could get any better, but you proved me wrong lmao. you have my respect stark.",2

There s still completely different situations. He *chooses* to donate to a church that openly admits to supporting conversion therapy. Intent doesn t mean shit of what they do is public knowledge.

Why did you insist on pushing captain marvel knowing how poorly it would have been received and shoehorning it into the infinity arch?,0
I would also accept *Immigrant Song intensifies*,3
At the start you see Cap s shield horizontal in front of Bucky. You then see the shield hesitantly being strapped in on someone s arm... is this a hint Bucky is stepping up? ,0
"He was, and even as a building poster in Deadpool 2",2
"Most people don t think that badly about the movie, just a bunch of r/fragilewhitepeople who are loud af. ",1
Okay. Why is captain marvel looking the opposite way. Oh those tricksters.,1
Man I wish it was April 27,1
"It s almost like they made Thor spend half a movie getting a new weapon, vision being crippled to begin the movie and hulk having a bad Monday to give Thanos a chance ",3
It's unfair how attractive this is.,1
"But does this means these character assassinations from the left and the right, or just for people who we thing are being wrongfully targeted?",1

Ah right I forgot that there's some trippy stuff that happens in the quantum realm,1
Well you don't need powers to be a leader. Just leadership qualities. For Cap that was his strategic thinking and strong moral compass.,1
It wasn't jokes. It was him saying suggestive things that a pedophile might think. Repetitively. In not a funny way. He was trying to normalize pedophilia. Saying that you got aroused when a monkey jizzed on a boy on a set is weird. Making comments like that every so often shows a sick person. ,0
"I feel like Avengers: Age of Ultron has got better with age. It wasn't received as well upon release, but I've always enjoyed it and I think people enjoy it more these days with it's connections to later films.",1
This shit is so forced.,1
What would your Moon Knight Film look like?,1
Tons of people enjoyed venom. Everyone enjoyed spiderverse and everyone enjoyed the first two Holland movies. The Sony can't produce good Spiderman movies narrative is so tired,1
"I wish I could give you gold, i am poor af",1
Haha I'm sure it's not a bad stereotype to have :),1
"i agree that a lot of marvel movies simply are popcorn movies but whats the problem? I liked the godfather, but i also like iron man. People can enjoy more than one thing.",3
You don't need to exclude people to Include more people. ,1
"Hartnett had some roles under his belt. Pearl Harbor and Black Hawk Down were pretty big hits, and he was great in Lucky Number Slevin (plus showed some good comedic timing there). Way better choice than Shia",2
"Better, yes, but  powerful ? I dunno...even Comics Tony could never really hang with the heavy hitters, even if his suits gave him a chance.",1
Too. Short. I wish there was more.,1
Omg so dope bro know what I mean?,1
"Guys, I think I found the Easter Egg!",1
"Theoretically, if every Spider-Man movie for the remainder of time made over  1 billion, it would still take 11 films before Disney broke even on the investment. That would obviously take over a decade, maybe even two, and Tom Holland would be long gone from the role. It s not a very good investment for Disney, they d be better off just buying Sony Pictures and getting all their IP.",1
"I used to be in the hospital when i was likr 4 and i even remember most weekly clown visits, i didn't even like clowns. Still don't tbh.",0

His plan to obtain the stones had nothing to do with Earth.   It was just a more efficient means to acheive his goal universally.,2
"RONIN, BOYS",1
Yah. The reason he has gloves on is to hide the ends of the fat suit.,2
Paul Rudd is the only one in the trailer  which keeps reminding us that it is a Disney movie.,1
Big movies have always overshadowed smaller moves. It s always been that way. People are living in fantasy worlds thinking it used to better.  Smaller movies used to get more of a chance. I d say smaller movies have more of a chance now that we have streaming. Netflix and Hulu are making stuff that I don t think would ever have been financed. .,3
"Avatar 2 movie goers in 2024: 5 years ago we lost, all of us, we lost fans, we lost our title, we lost part of our franchise, today we have a chance to take it all back, you know your teams, you know your theaters, get the tickets, give them money. Most of us are going back to a franchise we know, that doesn't mean we should know what to expect, be careful, look out for easter eggs, this is the fight of our lives, and we're gonna win, whatever it takes, good luck!",1

"I hope you live long enough to see Far From Home, too. So sorry to hear.",1
It's a movie.,0
Remove Capt. MARVEL.,0
He wasn't allowed to speak in that one scene alone. And that's because the character that silenced him hates foreigners. Martin Freeman does play an important part in the movie and is given defining character moments. Don't take a scene out of context to reinforce your argument.,1
James Gunn is officially back on GOTG,1
"That makes sense, thank you! I just saw an Apple+ or whatever it is commercial the other day, it s so interesting which companies try to become streaming services.",1
"I agree, i fully expect Dormammu's appearance to change as well, Derrickson pretty much made him more like a Galactus figure, from his look to the little nods spread through the movie( Devourer of worlds ).",2

At least they are talking again.  ,2
We re getting a fucking Shang Chi movie?!,1

Steve....please don t die!,1
"And on top of that, it came out in January instead of during the summer, and faced no real competition for *months*.  Combine no other movies biting into its box office, the rise of 3D and Imax with their increased ticket prices, and a level of word-of-mouth that was unheard of at that point saying you **have to** see this movie on the big screen, in 3D, in Imax, and it was the perfect storm for a movie to print money.",1
"Why didn't you like it? I for one loved it, but am interested to hear your point of view.",2
"No, that's Tag, Rachel's ex",3
"Hi Kevin, what would you say are the biggest challenges of intertwining so many different stories and characters into one cohesive thread the way the MCU has done it are?",1
"I feel they've kept her off the radar to avoid incorporating her characterization from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Considering the missions  Odin  tasked her with since TDW, if someone deserved a reaction to Loki usurping the throne, it was her.",1
"Yeah sure, Technology is making things easier (if you actually bothered to learn how to use it) let's stop using technology, it worked the last million years",1
Maybe the entire thing was a plot by the Soul Stone to obtain the souls of half the universe?,1
Wow. I have been replaying the trailer for the pass few minutes now. I swear only Infinity War trailer can make me do this. Marvel Studios has created a phenomena. ,1
"A movie that takes place between IW and Endgame, but features Strange and/or Black Panther? Have you watched the films, by chance?",2
We should have seen Tony in the way station with Yinsen. That really would have brought it full circle.,2
Most likely in this film,3
Who the fuck is the blue person with the gun? Were the Kree involved in this too because that doesn't look like Nebula.,1
"Yeah, even if it makes sense for dramatic reasons, he's incredibly valuable to drop in and take over Fury's role.  Holland did great in Homecoming, but Stark's brief appearance was fantastic.",1
How is he flying if he's not spinning his hammer really fast like he used to?,1
We dont need a dr doom movie.,2
Small Indie Company  TM,3
"This has been the plan for years now. Everything that comes out of Marvel Studios is MCU. That is the long game for Marvel. It took time and patience. They are not abandoning that model while it works. Who knows, 20 years down the line they might too give up on a universe and start pumping out stand alones  like DC. But, that would signal the downfall of comic movies in general and at that point there would be no point. - Opinion.",1

The person who says they've never told an off color joke before and the person who says they've never ever in their life had a racist thought or said something even remotely racist are both liars.,1
oh damn this is pretty good   how did you remove just the soundtrack btw?,1
Predators did it ,2
"Maybe some Asgardian magic can turn Jane Foster from Natalie Portman to Charlize Theron! When she looks like she s gonna kick some ass, I actually believe it!",0
The AI is now Friday. Tony calls it Friday in Avengers 3. ,2
It definitely deserves more attention. Too many people gave up in the beginning.,1
So basically she is the one punch man of the MCU is all I know about her,1
Man that s just depressing. Wishing Alexander all the best! ,3
Both were good for most of the stories. But I just can't picture Terrence in the Civil War storyline where he's paralyzed.,1
This trailer has a very  superman  vibe to it maybe its cuz I watched man of steal last week,1
Oho my friends my friends all is well with the galaxy ,1
What's your favorite season of Community?,1
"It is always great to see people who are apologetic about their former  child rape jokes, get all of their former standing back. He sure doesn't still think or feel that way. There is no way that could be the case. Why is everybody giving him a pass on this?",0

A small price to pay for IMAX,3
Was there any particular actor/actress that you could not believe agreed to come play their MCU role?,1
"I mean, Hela in Ragnarok is no where near similar to her comic counterpart. Hell, a ton of the mcu villains are nothing like the comics versions, so it's not like there isn't a precedent. If they go with an Unworthy-type arc for the movie, I can see it working so long as Waititi makes sure to balance the improv comedy with serious scenes.",1
Like Mahershala probably being 50 when he starts his franchise,1
Thank you Sarah Finn  3,1
I m guessing avengers 5 July 28 2023 right after Spider-Man 4 releases a month earlier to start the summer and ties into avengers 5 civil war to infinity war style.,0
I see we have another big portal in the sky. This might be Marvels version of the Death Star.,1
Airplane engine crashed through your roof directly onto your bedroom.,1
Yeah... That's true,1
"To be fair though, a lot of products have a bunch of features in  early adopter beta tester -quality. And beyond that, pretty much nothing is made to last anymore and we don't really know what to do with most of it once it's replaced. There's a reason we're making so much trash.",3

What's the name of the fair Asgardian maiden in purple robes? For research purposes.,1
And I matter enough to you that you have to prove yourself right getting the last word. Thank you! ,1
Still breaks up the pacing. It d feel weird and out of place. Why is he in the Mindscape? Did Strange put him there? Why would Strange be there?,3
Isn't Keanu on record saying he wants to reprise the role? Because I'd love another one,1
"At the end of black panther, T'Challa shows the kids his ship and one of the kids comes up to him and asks,  who are you . This kid being played by Alex Hibbert. Can this possibly be young Miles Morales? ",1

this would actually be awesome,1
Honestly. I m glad this was cut out. It just doesn t feel quite right.,0

This was one of the few marvel shows that was actually good,1
He's still alive in millions of other universes.  No problem,2
I want it and I need it,3
anyone remember who said the next trailer wouldn't be till april? im guessing manabyte but i can't remember ,1
HBO. I thought it was expensive,1
Someone on /r/unearthedarcana made 5e statblocks for the Avengers. It's one of the top posts of all time on that board.,2
Holy shit dude this is amazing,1
Okay man.  Your just running in circles saying  most people most people obvious obvious! It s still down to opinion for subjective material. Yours is different.  Weird how you don t care that Green Book won when it wasn t the most liked nomination by critics or fans.   I m not changing your mind and your definitely not changing mine. Go back to being triggered and blaming everyone else s ignorance. ,1
"Dude, this is awesome. Great work.",1
"Technically no, since Quill kills the screen before we see the search result.",2
 GO ON... I CAN TAKE IT! ,1
Trash Panda,2
Definitely an underrated moment ,3
Thats hot,2
Almost spit my drink out when I read this. Nice one!,1
Every marvel movie ends with that. Or some doomsday plot with intergalactic space bugs.,0
"I love The First Avenger, it s in my top 5 and has aged so well with what comes later. Love the WW2 stuff, the Howling Commandos, Peggy, Tommy Lee Jones chewing up the scenery, the relationship with Bucky...it s great  I d even go as far as to say the Cap trilogy (First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War) is one of the best film trilogy s of all time, not just comic book genre",2
Bring me my burd,1
So Nick Fury basically,3
HOLY COW. ,1
"Chris Evans is Captain America though, he s a great human being. ",3
/r/whoosh,2
"So surprised that they included this in in the trailer. Also, Carol isn't there? Makes me think there's something trixy going on with this and that scene is not what is appears.",1

Better than the GR arc? I stopped watching when they were in space,1

"At least he can still scuba. I mean, if he can t scuba, what s this all been about?",3
"The Russos get too much credit for Captain America. The people I've seen explain why their Captain America is better use arguments that make me think they haven't watched CA:TFA, at least, not sober. They went on record saying they didn't like Captain America before, and it shows. Beyond all action scenes, increased budget, etc, Steve's story has been hollow. Second unpopular opinion: confusing TFA for The Force Awakens is not interesting, actually.",2
Why Wanda though?,1
To me that s the worst part. I liked having the mystery unravel and be confirmed by marvel in a future film. It was a big topic of debate ever since the movie came out.,1
"Yeah, pretty much. ",2
THEORY.  CAP IS CAP.  CAP EATS PANTHER FLOWER.  CAP IS SUPER CAP. SUPER CAP CAN HOLD BACK THANOS FIST. BOOM. ,3
"I think that it's also important to remember that although it's the end of a Phase, and maybe a  generation  of Avengers, it's not the end of the Avengers or the MCU. *Avengers*  would also cause a lot of confusion among the more casual watchers, not the mention international audiences. ",2
They ll reach a deal. I m not sure which side leaked the info for leverage but they got the reaction they wanted. Disney will wind up taking 20  or something. I d bet my dick on it.,1
" Go get another haircut  haha but seriously, this looks great!",1
I feel like it will be a while before we learn Ultron is alive. ,1
thats just another thing LotR did right.,1
"Are any actors with expired contracts allowed to be drafted a new contract after their character exits? (For Example: Jeremy Renner, Paltrow, etc.)",1
 Lemme just ask this legendary auteur what he thinks of a genre of movie I don't like this genre of movie Look guys he doesn't like this genre of movie ,1
Money or gold isn t a problem anymore when you can shrink it and take it while you re an ant..,1
Endgame sucked chode,0
SQUAD!,3
100  this. It literally can t *not* be this answer.,1
So Loki is dead,1
Pewdiepie?! ,1
Thanks for the spoiler dick wad,0
"The writers and directors of Endgame disagree on how the time travel works. What's your take? Did Captain America live with Peggy in an alternate timeline as the time travel mechanics in the movie (as well as the Russos) suggest, or was he somehow her secret husband in the main timeline all along, as the writers say was their intention?",1
"Agreed, but I gotta say when Bruce told her that Strange gave the stone up and she paused, I thought for a split second that she was doubting him. I was very pleased by her actual reaction which was full faith",3
"With the confirmation of Tony and Nebula making it back to Earth, it occurred to me that we're going to get one hell of a heartbreaking scene when Nebula has to tell Rocket that ***all*** the other GOTG are dead.",1
It's clearly not 5 years later,1
Holy crap. That would be an amazing freaking twist. That would be ridiculously awesome. ,1
 around . It better not be 2hours 43 minutes. ,1
That was fucking amazing.,1
There are new readers every day. :-),1
Where's the scenes?,2
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.,1
"Kevin, thanks for doing this. Like others, I'm curious about your selection process for directors.  **What directors would you like to see playing in the MCU sandbox?**",2
A moment of silence.  I think I d fuckin cry.,2
Insane how the franchise has been able to create megastars like this.,3
I'd love a one shot of Korg streaming a Fortnite match on Twitch!,1
They can t do everything,3
"If you could change one thing about how FOX did Deadpool, even though it's a hit, what would it be?",1
Spider-Man PS4 was too good  I actually found myself agreeing with JJJ a few times.,3
Maybe that's him around 20s?  I can't tell who that is.,1
"I didn't know I wanted this, now I want nothing more.",1
Literally all I said were facts. You said they weren t that popular world wide and are only for children which are both objectively false. I get that Republicans aren t big on listening to facts but I thought you might be able to understand simple concepts. I guess I was being too optimistic. Also it s funny how you hate the movies but I looks like you watched it or were interested enough to read about it by the fact that you know what happens,1
Pretty much everyone fucked up in some way that led to Thanos' victory. If they would have blown up the Mind Stone when they first had the chance things might have gone differently.,2
All because of Stan lee,1
"Don t worry, *we* won t forget your feat :)",3
"Haven't paid much attention to the comics recently, but wasn't there some new Lebanese Green Lantern? Simon Baz or something? Considering he wielded a gun in some concept art I'm not sure that'd be a better pick though.",1
the transitions are so smooth its scary,1
This is a wild assumption that people make based on nothing at all. The fact is Disney has already confirmed that they are willing to have R rated characters in the MCU. They re wary about it but they re not fucking stupid either. ,2
I mean if you throw enough money at someone...,2
Favourite Marvel TV show atm?,1
Brie Larson was propelled into stardom because of this movie? She's been a proven actress for years my man  ,2
This was *excellent* work! I hops someone sees this and gives you the job of your dreams!,1
"True, but then I read stories like Al Dunlap s and I just seethe",1
"Plus, that was like the one thing that people constantly criticised about Jackman. I can see how they'd go for a more comics-faithful actor.",3
"It wasn't the first day or two when the announcement was made. But then again, twitter is the worst social media site for reactions, so who knows haha",3
 No they weren't (https://deadline.com/2019/03/james-gunn-reinstated-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-disney-suicide-squad-2-indefensible-social-media-messages-1202576444/) >Making the whole thing easier though was the fact that Marvel Studios never met with or considered any other director for Guardians of the Galaxy 3 ,2
"Since this timeline is fucked. Imagine, we could live in a Shia Thor era where MCU was shit vs the shit that is going on. I still would pick Chris but could ya picture Shia hilariously miscasted as Thor for the greater good.",1
"Incredible art piece, good job!",1
Anyone else not really trust that shot of Cap in the Winter Soldier suit? Something about that shot is just highly suspicious to me. Maybe because there's almost 0 movement and the next couple shots of that scene are from the shoulders up. I think they're hiding a new suit for some reason. ,1
OMG YES!!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,1
INSERT MICHAEL SCOTT 'IT'S HAPPENING' GIF!,3
Needs more Korg,1
">!Michael Douglas said there was a scene with everyone, but putting them on their own poster would probably be too obvious. Also it probably messes up the ratios! ",3
"Love that scene. Not a perfect movie, but fun enough that I saw it 2-3 times in the theater. One of the times there was a  10yo kid next to me who clearly knew the comics well, and he was LOVING the movie - watching it through his eyes made me like it even more.",3
Is that guy good? He turned bad is what I thought then.,0
His videos have really made me a marvel fanboy ,2
I may have impulsively downvoted. But know that you have my respect.,1
"- how long, roughly, will we have to wait to see X-men/Deadpool in mcu? - I know you won t say who but do you have someone in mind for wolverine? - with the edition of X-men will there be more movies each year? - as much as I am pumped for black widows movie I can t be the only one who thinks it s too late..? An origin movie of a deceased character after the original story is over..how will this progress the upcoming story?",1
1. Are there plans to bring Namor into the MCU? 2. Is Loki or some version of Loki alive after end game in the MCU?  Any details at all you could give at all about these two questions would be appreciated. Thank you.,1
Nah he doesn't have to now that >!Thor got fat! . He's got no competition.,1
"True, and if it wasn't for them the MCU wouldn't be readily accepted. Even so, none of the MCU past Avengers 1 makes sense. How the fuck were we watching all those films and enjoying them? I mean, besides being generally good, well-made (7-8/10 minimum) movies?",3
"He even said it to Tony in Iron man 2. He called Tony his greatest creation. Unfortunately, it's as you said, he loved Tony, but wasn't able to express it in the way Tony wanted.",3
Honestly it's just not very good.,1
No Agent Hill?! ,1
"5/10 avengers shown, perfectly balanced.",1
This was all literally 4chan's doing. ,1
Marvel ought to use this when they announce the 22 movie box set...,1
">I think the problem is they didn't really make the rest of the characters very understanding of Thor's feelings, or even aware of them at all, We missed about 5 years of interactions between some of those characters.",2

Humans see patterns where they want to see it.,1
"Her movie did gang busters at the box office, regardless of her performance or her politics. She s 99.999  locked in",0
Watching this on the toilet at 1am was weirdly special. Hype + drain pipe. ,1

Only difference is it's selling really well.,1
"Yeah, he also said that the stones together work much like a wish where your intent is taken into consideration. I suspect that's the power of the soul stone.",3
"As much as I love Gorr, I don t see them going in that direction, and frankly I feel like it would be wildly out of place in the MCU unless they changed him up quite a bit, which I can t see them doing without really losing the soul of what makes Gorr so cool",1
Go see it again. You won t regret it.,1
"I don't see how Akira is going to be anything but a disappointment.  I haven't read the books, but apparently the movie did a shit job of adapting them.  If you go back and watch Akira its confusing as fuck.  Which is a testament to where it did get it right, as I love that movie and never seem to be able to figure out exactly whats going on. x200B I don't see how its possible to one up a movie that most people who watch it dont understand whats going on yet still enjoy it.",2
"Reviews for Pikachu are actually pretty negative. And Pokemon may be a big franchise, but the movie is very different from what people grew up with, and gaming movies have a history of underperforming. Pikachu won't be the major hit people think it is. It'll probably make some money, but it won't be a big hit. And it wouldn't surprise me if it bombed either.",0
"As we currently refer to the star wars  original trilogy  and have marathons of it, we will have the MCU  original duovigintilogy .",1
Yes it was heartwarming to  see all 7 guys walking together in a line. ,1
"So, we're in the End Game now.",1
"If they stuck to the original plan and try to stay unnoticed, it'd be fine until Loki escapes, but what would that really change? Dark World plays out differently? The big difference would be with Cap staying in the past, would he be able to resist changing things? If you save Bucky before he gets controlled into killing the Starks, then maybe Tony turns out different? I'd imagine he'd still get captured and end up building his own suit though like he did in Iron Man 1.",2
THE FUCK,1
"I almost went there, ecept that would be a looooong opening sequence, ha.",2

Mind. Blown.,1
Reason  8: The box sets are way more expensive than any of the other MCU shows' box sets for some reason.,1
How close were the Defenders to being in Infinity War/Endgame?,2
Thank you!   I didn't model this one. I got the 3D model from Thingiverse but made some adjustments on the model on Meshmixer before I print it.,1
Release the hype engine,1
Mandalorian also has 2 extra episodes and 50k less of a budget. The budget per episode for FaTWS is double the budget per episode of Mandalorian so it adds up,3
..duh? Such a pointless thing to say ,3
hehehe,1
THIS TRAILER IS GODLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. INFINITY WAR will be AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.,1
Without adjusting for inflation. Which is the norm for some reason.,1
"It's sad that this all comes down to spite. I understand that Feige and others were upset that the TV side was doing things they didn't agree with, and that led to resentment...but the fact is that some of that stuff was great.  Daredevil especially.  So it's sad to see Feige going for a full reboot when it's really not necessary. That's throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",3
I guess he'll still be able to shoot web with two broken arms,2
I think they mean only in the MCU. That or I missed some major scenes/easter eggs regarding Spidey.,2

Black Panther is a lead farmer confirmed.,3
What's  your favorite marvel movie moment?,1
I only made it I don't know maybe a third or half way through the show but I thought Natalie Dormer being Moriarty was just to cover it is so weird.,1
"I bet Tony dies in space in the opener. Hits us hard in the feels. Time travel occurs, we get young Tony.",1
The one movie deal seems like a stopgap deal while they work on something bigger in the background. I would be 100  fine with Tom being part of the MCU and the Venomverse,1

"> They could have a thing like the Good Place, where all the swearing is replaced with similar words like  forking shirt It seems that you need to see the hilariously censored version of DP2 where they do exactly this. They re-shot EVERY LAST curse word with  cheese and crackers  types replacements to reach PG-13 rating.",3
He also gave it to Jeri Ryan in Star Trek Voyager.,1
"Not just that, but the second movie had to come up with a plot device to show his pre-disfigurement face. Just showing ugly Ryan Reynolds apparently didn't count toward face time.",1
So glad the trailer didn't really reveal anything. There's so much hype around it we don't need to know the plot. Here's to Round 2 of hoping that Cap and Tony don't die and get a happy ending.,1
I know people say >!'That's not how that works!'!  but I completely agree. >!I'd honestly be so upset watching a 'prequel' knowing her demise is permanent and imminent in Endgame.

"I mean, the Wakanda warriors just look like highly trained warriors with lazer guns. There's no reason the government would stop trying to create super soldiers of any kind, whether they be bio-weapons or mechanical suits. Wakanda has also shared their technology with the world, and vibranium really isn't the only thing they have going for them. The Iron Legion is a great example- the government would do a similar thing. The hammerbots would be a really good addition to the army had they not been bad guys.",1

I was wondering if you ve ever talked to anybody about promoting current marvel comics, as it is well known that you are a comics fan and I think that if you can make comic movies mainstream, then you can also do the same with comics. Also, what do you think about the DCEU breaking away from the MCU formula?",1

I'm also very confident that Charlie will return, he is simply too perfect for anyone to replace him and I have faith that the powers at Disney   Marvel will make it happen.",1

By the way if he says he regretted something it may make people think this MCU's endgame is not the chosen one. It's a question that should not be answered at all. So he chose something no one can exploit: Thor's eyebrows.",0

He would have been more known but still he was in two mediocre/bad superhero movies that happened like 5 years before he was Captain America and he was never really in anything else big.

Why not just let every person with severe stage cancer watch the movie while we re at it. Equality man,1
I could maybe see that. Although it seems like Thor 4 will be centered around Thor and She-Thor so if he was it d be a very quick appearance which still makes me think they wouldn t wanna waste his one Marvel movie on a cameo. My prediction is they save it for the first Avengers movie in Phase 5 and then go from there on whether or not Sony allows them to continue using the character,1

Where do you see ironman in wakanda? Hulk is in the hulkbuster and then war machine is there too. Stark is fighting thanos with Strange and the rest in New york.,1

She damn cute...,1
"I was in the theatre when she was there! I was already watching the movie with my dad so i didn t go with my friend, he ended up in the theatre with her and to say the least I m upset about my decision making. I was a half hour showing off from meeting her!",1

Any chances you'll keep Sophie Turner under MCU?,1
When sonic ran into those spikes? Yeah man that was crazy.,1
Pretty Lady! Maybe you should have played the role!,1
"Sorry, man. Didn't mean to upset you. I just felt like it was a fair question since we were talking about people who were threats to Thanos. If not power or a character's fighting capabilities, I'm not sure what measure I should have used to quantify how much of an individual threat a comic book character is.  I'm open to suggestions.",0
Maybe because Thor was using it,3
Can't wait to see Aunt May age gracefully within a few years.,1
Then we should very disappointing cancel Netflix subscription. ,1
I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!,1
"Yes, that s what I said. Read my post again.",1
"IIRC, Feigi said that all stones would be introduced before Infinity War. It looks like he ll start off with the Power stone, followed by attacking Thor and sending him/Hulk off into space when he gets the Space stone. Afterwards he ll go to NYC for the Time and Mind stone and at the same time send an army to Wakanda for the Soul stone. Not sure about where the Reality stone will fit in here.",2

I guess this is reddits new favorite female actor. Sorry Gal Gadot you're old news.,1
"I know what you mean, but I can see why they decided not to do it in Infinity War or Endgame. It would have been too restricted if it was squashed into the already-full story.

Yeah but neck injuries are gonna skyrocket.,2
"Sony has just gotten cocky because venom did numbers and spider-verse won an Oscar. 50/50 split for financing and profits is a fair deal, sure less profits but they re spending less.  With their upcoming Spider-Man villain movies they re obviously trying to set up their own little universe. This was probably their plan all along.",1
"James Cameron is going to be really, really REALLY mad about this.",1
" Marvel Rolls Dice, Casts No-Names for Thor along with Academy Award Winners Sir Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman     To even assume there was money saved in casting that could be spent on special effects like in Star Trek, is insane. Both Natalie and Sir Hopkins are fully out of the franchise now  I suspect their time is too precious to be spent on this franchise now.",3
Could be Canadian Thanksgiving was weeks ago here,3
Damn I just realized that there are actually 2 actors from Parcs   Rec in the MCU! I hope Ben (Adam Scott) joins the club soon.,3
"I really didn't think Chris Hemsworth would be sticking around, and all it really says is that he'll be reprising his role...  Wouldn't amaze me if we transfer to a different Thor (probably female Thor, although I doubt they'd want to go the Natalie Portman route).",1
"Hello there Kevin, You've been president of Marvel for 11 years (I think) so, how did it feel getting nominated for an Oscar for Black Panther. It would be interesting to find out how you felt after 10 years of hard work so I hope you answer my question. Thanks",1
Aw sad day,3

Someone add Colin Kaepernick to this video please.,1
If you could add a DC character to the MCU wich would you pick?,1
Being president and the director of a superhero film are two very different levels of responsibility. I wouldn't vote for James Gunn to be president either. The difference is Gunn lost his essentially meaningless job and Trump sits in the whitehouse right now. Saying Trump should be stopped from running for president exclusively because of those comments is stupid. But saying it should stop any reasonable person from voting for him isn't.,2
"Yeah I can t believe how many people still don t understand that whenever you go back in time in the MCU you create an alternate branched timeline, so cap created an alternate timeline when he went back to live with Peggy",3
"> I started writing a book, named Steve s son James without realizing I did it subconsciously because of this movie. Lol crazy how that works.  Well, it makes sense.... I'm pretty sure he's supposed to be named after after Cap's old war buddy, James Buchanan  Bucky  Barnes.",3

"u/joe-Russo u/Anthony-russo u/Marvel-official Russo s, I ve come to bargain.  I ll act as balance tribute  and watch the movie as late as he does early.  Can show my Thanos  statue or movie collection for validation I m a fan.",1
He's my favourite character in the MCU. I watch agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. purely because of him!  What I meant was that it's nice to see him back in the movies! ,2

"I mean they re people with their own lives who value their own time. If you ve got thousands of fans lining up to get autographs, you d charge per person too.",2
Hi Kevin. First of all thank you for all you've done. The MCU is THE generation event and we love you for it. Two questions: 1. Do you plan on doing a series/movie/one shot of Steve returning the stones? 2. Is there anything we should expect of tony stark moving on or should we say our definite goodbyes?,1
That's gorgeous too!,1
He doesn't need to be resurrected by hulk. He can be reincarnated by the kree supreme intelligence. Play up the role of the kree as a space empire and lead into the secret wars they're hinting at with the skulls. Make Ronan come back as an enforcer from the supreme intelligence and do their homeworld domination thing they do. Marvel had to defend those who cannot do it themselves. Basically make her voltron.,1
Plot twist: these accounts are corporate,2
"Nah I hope Thor 4 strays away from the outer space and sci-fi stuff, unless they deal with Gorr the God Butcher. Thor is a magic based character, and should deal with demons, Gods, and mystical realms.",3

"In the show Ghost Rider can do the ring thing, so not too far-fetched",1
You notice how much emphasis he put on the word rescue? That was not coincidental. We are totally getting Rescue in this movie.,3
"Yes!! People are calling it out as fat shaming, but it s very realistic that people cope with PTSD through excessive food and alcohol (and other vices). I really loved Thor s arc in this film, and I thought it would have been more fat shaming to make him  get fit  before the big battle.",3

Now that's ironic.,1
This is truly amazing! You should be paid for this,1
Spider-man has always been a fan favourite.  The excitement that he COULD be the central character of the avengers is legitimate. However that could just be wishful thinking.  Can we actually expect Peter Parker to be the new central character of the MCU? That d  make many fans happy,1

I saw it at like 16-18 and loved it since it was fun adventure like the mummy or pirates of the Caribbean. I rewatched it just last year and still enjoyed it. That poor actress career though. Died after this film and John Carter. She's from my hometown Houston too,1

"I love the Dark Knight. I love Nolan. Snyder is no Nolan and with the exception of Wonder Woman, DC has failed to put out a decent movie since the Dark Knight series.  Nolan clearly had a vision for his movies and the universe his Batman inhabited. IMO, Snyder just doesn't have that vision. It's like the only lesson he learned from Nolan is male DC movies dark, with sad, emo heroes. I love the DCU, which is why it angers me that they're squandering away what should be a slam dunk.  ",1

"You don't think Marvel is justified in getting half the profits to MCU Spider-man? Sony proved that they can't handle the property after Spider-man 2, and everything that is great about this version of Spider-man comes from Marvel understanding what is great about the character, and then sticking him in the most ambitious series of movies in film history. Marvel deserves half that money, they are doing the work that is making billions.",2

Honestly I'd start with Thanos Quest, that rolls into Gauntlet.  https://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-thanos-reading-order-guide/ The Infinity War was ok. Don't sweat not reading it, you can skip things until the 2010's.  The entire Hickmen run on Avengers was good and Infinity was so worth it.  Since the MCU hasn't kept lockstep with the comics and characters from Infinity are in this movie it's worth reading. ",2

All three of those failed attempts were live action.

I think he wanted to adapt Sun Vulcan, if I remember right. Power Rangers could've been HIS thing, isn't that wild? His reach extended so far, even outside comics.",1
"Agreed.  With the fact that the software/program got away at the end with the escaping  staffers , they could easily bring Mysterio back even without Beck.  It's really a  We are Negan -type moment.",2
And Gunn dropped the same idiotic mob-rule made-up b.s. about Ben being some kind of racist neo-nazi alt-righter. Yet here we are watching the world unite behind Gunn for things he *actually said* but a vast swath of his defenders believe Ben should be loathed for things he *never said* This whole situation is so stupid I can't even breathe.,0
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vfqkvwW2fs If you haven't seen this, Every Frame Is a Painting talks about the lack of amazing music in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ",1
god damn it. I'm mad I didn't notice this.,3
Too early for VFX is my guess,3
Tony Broke that cycle a long time ago,1
Chris Evans said its not a hard no but not an eager yes. Seems like he would be up to reprise the role as long as its meaningful and enough time has passed for him to do other projects that he wants to do. Not impossible but don't hold your breath.,2
"Because he was sending others to get the stones, but once Odin was dead, he started seeking them himself. Odin was the one he feared most",0

"Honestly, the last season ended on a pretty good note. Still some unanswered questions, sure, but it's a good finale. ",3

* I hope they remember you * I'M NOT READY FOR THIS,1
Hi Kevin! 11 years ago did you think this universe would be as successful as it is today. What were your hopes for Iron Man and how did the reception of it make you feel towards this upcoming franchise?  Thank you for having the time to do this!,1
They played him like a damn fiddle!,1
"Ragnarok was PRETTY bad. Bad comedy, bad acting. Destroyed a great story. Yep. Thats all.   and there are LOTS of better movies out there",0

"Just take a look at who the producers and executives of the MCU are.  How much diversity is there?  If you like the MCU, you're definitely a white supremacist who enjoys a bunch of white people telling POC how to behave and what to say.",1
Will Stan Lee make cameos on billboards or background paintings?,0
"I read that, when aboard Ebony Maw's ship, Tony would throw nanotech at Strange to free him and Stark would somehow get the cloak. It was only for that scene. I'm not sure about the veracity of this, I read it on Instagram through an MCU news page. Edit: saw the official artbook, it's legit. It would've been such a cool scene!",3
That is so close to the plot in The leftovers.,1
It was even better the 3rd time around.,1
Did they think that people would forget that the movie based on a Disneyland ride was owned by Disney?,3
There IS a spoiler tag.,1
I want Danny DeVito as the Mole Man when they finally do Fantastic 4,1

It's nice to see you again.,1
The film is definitely stronger without this scene. glad it was cut.,0
A reality where baby Thanos was killed. Possible What If episode?,3
"I hate Captin Marvel as a character but I LOVE this even more, fuckin fire!",0
"Her movie seemed like they had to rush to introduce her into Endgame and be strong enough to fight Thanos. Release her movie before Infinity war, make her weaker in her movie   make her super strong in Endgame to be a surprise, and maybe give her some screentime w/ the Avengers for chemistry and problem solved",2
Hank paid him for the heist job guys.... either that or it used to be a dollhouse.,1
Seeing Cap with Mjolnir STILL makes me a little emotional.,1
because why?,1
Is agents of s.h.i.e.l.d is still canon?,1
I never watched the last couple of episodes before it got pulled from Netflix. Pity too.  (Though if memory serves I think it had something to do with how they changed the story telling or something),1
Yes but they always stay looking up,1
I love this ,1
I was a fan,3

"Many moons ago, circa 2000 in the early days of the internet I found Bruce Campbell's email, aka Ash. I sent an email that was roughly *Dear Bruce's PR team.

Kid, B grade horror plays way less than you think. Thanks for the kind words. Here's an animated gif Ash being awesome. Bruce* I mean, it still could be PR, but if it was, it was great.",3

Except that both Disney and Gunn have made/said mistakes in the past. Disney managed to bounce back (by basically pretending they were never racist to begin with). Why shouldn t James Gunn have the same opportunity?,2
No way do they use  annihilation  for anything that doesn't involve Annihilus.,3
"I feel like you're half right. The first part was fun, but they should have gone a lot darker once they escaped the planet. It was too flippant and didn't really match the story. Just my opinion. Half the movie sucked.",1
Lol nah she doesn t have enough directing experience for a marvel production,1
Are there any scenes in endgame that didn t make the cut that you wish had?,1
"I m really hoping it s one, but I would really rather not have 2 happen. Although I think another MCU director could take over, and while I love most of them, I really think that Gunn is the true owner of GoG and that making it without him just wouldn t be the same. ",3
"I also have mad respect that even at the face of the public, he was very passionate about supporting Gun. Unwavering. I remember that interview where Kevin Hart had to stop him before he talks shit about Disney or something. Shows real character and loyalty when most celebrities would brush it off and act coy about the situation. ",2
Ewww they made the right call to cut that shit,1
Acts like hammurderer you mean?,1
"This is the only enjoyable and good Marvel edit I've seen in my life. Good job, it's ao ridiculously good",1
Disney,1
He s had Mjolnir for a very long time. He could have done that with Mjolnir.,1
Disney should trade Star Wars for Spidey.  It s not like Disney knows what the hell it is doing with Star Wars.,0

R.I.P to a legend who's characters and stories truely changed the world around us.,1
I'm so excited and i just can't hide it,1
Thank you mate took me quite a while,1
I think it was good to have a bit of a dry spell. After Endgame a lot of casual fans were getting a little  superhero fatigue  and I have friends that intentionally didn t see FFH because they were a little bit tired of marvel.  Now that it s been a while we can get all the casual fans back in the game.  The only real loss has been the sharp decline of the meme subs like r/thanosdidnothingwrong since they need new material,3
I feel like if strange attacked her she would get pissed and try to wipe it off the map,1
"Lighter, actually",1
do you know what sub you're on?,1
"The cynic in me says Disney wants him back and wants to give the GotG cast some viral credit if it happens. This letter doesn't mention Disney and is super positive. The optimist in me thinks that if this is Disney changing course on this, that they are capable of sort of saying they were wrong.  Either way, the James Gunn firing is a dangerous precedent and a reversal would be good...",1
Would've been more ballsy/impactful if they would have threatened to quit.,3
"Titan definitely, Better choreography, cinematography, and villain.",1
"As far as we know, it will deal with where Black Widow went during/after the Civil War story. So it fills in her side of a story.",1
Didn't see that coming,1
"> Listen sweetheart, the world's changed alright. There are no creeps, there are no heroes. There are only people who are alive, and people who are FUCKIN DEAD.",1
Depends. How quickly are we demolishing the planet? Oh? The Amazon is on fire? I'm pretty sure it's not too long then...,1
They were so good together in the last one so it makes sense that they'd work together again ,3
I'm not insane! Thank you! Glad that's the first comment.,1
I really like your art style. Good job!,2
"Those fucking disks, think I must still have a few jammed at the back of books shelfs",3
Who the fuck is Travis?,1

He holds the bottle for actors to piss in when they're in encumbering costumes,0
 The best of us ,1
Are there any Marvel storyline s that you look at as potentially being unfilmable but still want to take on a challenge and have a crack at it anyway to see if that notion is true or not?,1
You can still enjoy them. Never to late.,3
Is it even possible for a marvel movie to tank at this point? I m pretty sure a squirrel girl movie would do well.,2
Were there any alternate endings discussed for endgame? If so could you share?,1
"I feel like I m in the twilight zone right now. The guy  joked  about little kids touching his dick. I don t care if you re trying to be edgy, you re an adult posting that on social media.  You think your current company would like that? Disney doesn t need that shit ",1
When did he do that card trick?,1
"Now that Blindspot is ending * can we have Sif come back? Perhaps in Thor 4 he goes to find out where she's been (it has been confirmed she didn't die at Asgard, if she was snapped she was brought back) and ends up embroiled in a fight against Mangog or Gorr, the God Butcher.  Shit, maybe Taika writes a zany cosmic rom-com love story between Thor and Sif? x200B It hasn't been cancelled, fuck.",1
"Something I haven't seen anyone mention yet is how this will play into Guardians of the Galaxy 3. Presumably that would come first? I'm wondering if we could potentially see Groot or Rocker join Thor for his 4th film.  Either way it's really exciting that Thor started out as the least popular of the big 3, and is now going to be the only one to get a 4th movie.",3
 See what happens next... May 2019 ,1
Pretty sure it was a flashback to young Gamora,2
Because their movies aren't making money anymore,0
"Hey there Mr. Feige, I've got one important question to ask: How do you like your eggs?",1
Thor went from speaking Shakespearean English to arguably the funniest character in the MCU. How do you like your steak?,0
Glad to be here with you all!,1
"Not gonna lie, this is probably too much, especially for casuals. Was the July 2021 date moved from something else, or was it conspicuously absent from the previous announcements?",1
Glad to see Matthew Berry make it onto the cover,3
That part got me all weak,3
I kinda like End Game. It's got a comicy feel to it. ,1
"Not really, IMHO.  Clark's had his powers from birth  we just see some pivotal moments in his life where he got total shit advice from his parents.  Plus he's not Superman until the end of the film.",2
... and why is it Moon Knight?,1
Thank you - though for some reason it s only showing the centre section of it,1
"yeah i mean on paper but all the figuratively dead and the literally dead people goin in the same graveyard, doesnt matter what movies they did or didnt get to see know what i mean? listen im not a bad guy. I like marvel movies and I help a lot of people. ",0
"Maybe they should talk to Disney since it's their own fault to not make an agreement with Sony, Sony has the rights to Spider-Man from the beginning, it's obvious that they don't want split 50 50. Disney should either step down on the offer to make sony happy or just buy  Spider-Man since we know they got the money to do it. I just don't want to see another reboot please",1
And a lot of money and fame and a lot of people around who have vested interest in you making millions of dollars so they can get a big cut of it. ,1
Definitely sounded Ultron-esque to me too.  I think it's a clever rouse though and its thanos speaking.  There are going to be so many red-herrings being put out.  If Ultron was back I'd be okay with it. (Dont forget we might see Ultron again for Vision.),2
I feel like he doesn t like being the Black Panther,0

"Carrie Fisher was Princess Leia, but Stan Lee created Spider Man, the Hulk, the X-Men, Daredevil, and countless other characters that had impacts on our lives.",3
Seems more practical too. Having everything slowly manifest at once can obscure your vision. Having it drop down is more instantaneous and won't leave you vulnerable.,1
"Why would you release a trailer for Far From Home before Endgame's theatrical release, essentially spoiling that the Avengers are able to reverse the snap from Infinity War?",1
Plaid.,1
Damn...that looks bad ass. So geeked!!!,1
I honestly do not know what your opinion is on this matter. ,0
"Into the spider-verse was average?  Also, this is 100  Disney's fault, not Sony's. Disney suggested a totally unfair deal. There are reports that Sony tried to find a compromise but Disney refused to negotiate (although there are also reports that Sony are the ones who refused to negotiate).",3

"There's no way they'd do this, but it would be a truly amazing way to deal with all this.",3
I guess this is one of those rare situations where child rape jokes aged well?,0
"When I read my first Spider comic when I was 8.  I don't give a fuck about Disney, nor did I do it for them, I did it because I enjoyed the movie.  Really pathetic to get angry over someone's enjoyment.",1
Yes literally watched this scene yesterday I couldn t remember the old on in AMATW,1

Do they get to see Stan Lee next?,1
"The overwhelming view on this sub is that if it isn't MCU cannon, and if you don't personally like it then the movie wasn't a success. It's also really frustrating that people view Disney as being the rightful owners of Marvel characters. I would be happy with all Marvel characters being in the MCU, but if that can't happen I'm not going to hope that all non-Disney content fails.",2

"Absolutely incredible, I feel just as, if not more, giddy now as I did when I was 11 years old watching the first Iron Man. I know it s  just a trailer  but what an accomplishment by Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios by crafting this universe over the course of 10 years to have it all lead up to something this spectacular.",3
This is one of a few different reasons I was not a fan of Ragnarok though. Every moment that tries to be tad bit serious was immediately undercut by a joke and the scenes lost all tension. It s as if the film was to afraid to let the characters and audience feel anything that wasn t  funny .,0

Would they risk getting fired themselves if they did?",0

"Hello Kevin! x200B First off, thanks for all the hard work you and your team put into these movies. Secondly, I want to know what plans y'all have for the Cosmic Side of things? What I mean was the Original Infinity Gauntlet story line dealt with Cosmic Beings of unimaginable power, will those characters ever get incorporated into the MCU or is that just too much for the big screen?",1

"My guess is that he asks for a ship, gets a quinjet, since they can fly in space apparently due to hulk being in one, and finds Tony on the guardians ship due to a tracking device of some sort",1
"Yeah but the first deal was homecoming and civil war, and second deal was ffh+two avengers movies, right?

"While he is clearly talking to Pepper, the woman who helped him becoming a better man, he is also talking to the iron mask literally (as a communication device) **and** symbolicaly because the mask/suit - just like Pepper - helped him become a better man, a hero. Hence Tony  when he drifts off, will dream about it  (literally = Pepper/symbolicaly = the suit). Both Pepper and the iron suit (or mask) are the two things Tony loves the most in the world. ",3
He'll be Thanos' new creepy assistant.  The one Ronan killed in GotG.,1
WOOOOO!,3
Your friends have actually not grown up yet at all because they're fucking 18 years old. This is about the age where you think you have it all figured out and talk in a know-it-all tone of voice at parties and elsewhere and then cringe really hard thinking back on it 10 years later when you realize you were just a punk ass kid. I envy you for your youth. Enjoy the movie.,1

"Also not a single shot of action other than Clint cleaning his sword.  Other weird thing that other than  Japanese street  and briefly Thanos' farm, the only locations we see are the Benetar and the Avengers HQ. So unless the entire film is Tony getting back from Titan and the Avengers moping around the HQ, this footage is probably all from the first 20 minutes or at least first act.",3

"I honestly don t have any real stake in this game, they re both huge corporations playing us for our money. But I do think the MCU films are leagues better than the Sony films (ITSV is really good though) and I like the continuity that Spidey is playing in now. They can afford it, I guess corporations gonna corporate. I just want everything to be like it was yesterday.  Ultimately I won t die if the deal really falls through. It ll disappoint me but at least we got some great MCU Spidey stuff.",2
He literally punched Captain Marvel out of the entire rest of the movie with it in End Game. Looked like he sent her into fucking space.,2
Alright. The wait commences.,1
"If you're not a paid professional, you damn well should be. I'm not even a fan of the films, but damn, this is fantastically well done.",1
That seems like a very weak confirmation that  yes the movie will come out . It sounds like they're still gonna dump it on Hulu.,1
Oh wow i'm actually really happy. Everyone deserves a second chance.,1
This is true,1

"> and everyone for months said that it would NEVER be the title. Didn't the Russo brothers state that he title wasn't mentioned in Avengers 3?  Endgame was mentioned, so they lied.",3
"Yep, given the history of Russo brothers trailers it is altogether likely that this entire trailer is a lie, and that not one shot in it will show up in the finished film.",1
"As I mentioned to someone else, in these situations Marvel says the characters are related.  Peter Parker s principle was a Howling Commando. They made him his grandfather or whatever. But also no one knows what Star Lord s mom looks like that well. In comparison to Mahershala Ali, whose an Oscar winner. But in the end we ll just wait and see what Kevin Feige says and does. All we ve seen is these shows getting cancelled so far. We ll see what he says in the future.",1

"Not when you factor in Disney taking on 50  of the budget as well. Marvel isnt just good at making comic book movies, they are good at making them on a reasonable budget. Sony spent  90 million more on the budget for ASM 2 (This doesnt account for Marketing, which was rumored to be in the  200 million range as well) than Marvel did for FFH and it made  400 million less.",1
"To be fair, the MCU as a whole is epic, but each individual movie is ok. They aren't works of art, but something good to watch on a Friday night. Michael Bay movies make millions but I wouldn't consider them  cinema  either",1

Basically NandovMovies and a bunch of movie essayist got together to make a video about one scene they liked spanning across all marvel movies. Originally there were about 10-12 but now there are 33. If some rando wants to make a video about a scene they love they ll be added to the list.  Here s the link.  (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd7v7nQLQGwKQxfPtUPz6i1h3-JVxBx0D) Enjoy.,1

Ok so who do we think Katherine Langford (13 Reasons Why girl) is gonna play? Her casting of all things has been kept air tight. ,1
"Yeah he looks so deep in thought at the same time. You can tell from his expression that there might be some guilt in there. He knew all along that Tony dying was the only way for them to win and there was nothing he could do to change that, he saw other alternates where he could try and they all lead to Thanos winning once again. Props to Cumberbatch's acting!!",2

Keep those spirits high. Enjoy the movie. Tons of positive energy to ya man.,1
In this case yes. Civil War movie is leagues better than the comic.,1
"Tony solved time travel accidentally and who's to say Shuri wouldn't have worked it out sooner.  He's also dead so he isn't the smartest guy in the MCU anyway. Edit: Also, the fact Wakandan tech is *far* more advanced than the rest of the world, even Tony, means even their average scientists are probably as smart if not more than he is. So Shuri definitely would be.",2
Go on 4chan and by this same logic everyone who has ever been anywhere on that site should be in jail. Another reality is that Disney knew the Tweets were out there when they hired him. They hired him then backed out because of a witch hunt. Like befriending the village mean girl then burning her at the stake later on because of mob mentality. ,2
"Well it ain't America's Ass, that's for sure.",3
"lol it's tarantino, not exactly a risk. If Sony didn't fund it someone else would've",3

It s canon. It just doesn t go out of its way to connect currently,3
Reminds me of when Bojack Horseman would have flashbacks and would over exaggerate the time period,2

The fact this has caused such scandal shows just how fragile of snowflakes some white males are. She has even said she's not saying less seats at the table for white men but adding more seats to allow more diversity. Good on her and to fuck with the snowflakes who are reacting so venomously. ,3
That is way too cheesy for my taste.,0

Nah. It must have cost at least a milkshake. ,1

Quantum congratulations.,2
I second this motion! And the possibility of maybe a Clea coming into spectrum?,1
I bet this is damage repair for the dumb shit she said. I am surprised Disney hasn t fired her yet.  Edit haha the same pussies downvoting would be crying if she said the same thing about black people. Man you fucks are racist. ,0

Amazing? No. Terrible? Absolutely not.,1

"Hi Kevin, I have been watching the MCU ever since I was in the eighth grade. There are a lot of Marvel characters that people love and that they wish  to see in the MCU. My question is... Is it possible to see a character like Daredevil show up in the films and if so are we going to see Charlie Cox return to his role as Matt Murdock?",1
Cap is fucking livid.,2
Vibranium could have some significance. I can imagine Stark and Rocket building some Anti-Gauntlet weapon out of that stuff in Wakanda.,1
Both teams played hard.,1
Aunt May s Revenge,1
"I would be okay with him having his own backstory and reasons. Actually maybe that would be best because god-like force of nature villains aren t relatable or fun to watch. I still feel as though they are setting him up in the MCU with Guardians lore, but it could be completely unconnected to Thanos. I m also totally on board with moving past the stones and not having them play further roles in the story.",1

That s what I said.  ),2
"Why would they release the first trailer showing how Tony is struggling to stay alive but then show him back on Earth with everyone? Sure we knew that they weren't going to kill him off like that but idk, kinda makes that scene where he's recording a message for Pepper lose its tension. **Edit**: why the downvotes?  **Edit**: evened out now **Edit**: lmao",0

I could see Evans doing a cameo roll to help train Sam I suppose?   As I found Sam an odd choice over Bucky (I know comics wise Wilson became cap America for awhile so likely why they did it ).   But... He's just a regular guy with a fancy wing suit. No superb training no super serum etc.   Bucky at least has the knock off soviet serum and the metal arm so he'd be closer to a  super soldier '.,1

Anyway, my question is, was it always a plan to have cap wield Mjolnir and for him to say 'avengers assemble' in endgame, or was it built upon the teasing in age of Ultron?  Thank you for taking the time to answer our questions! (And thank you for the wonderful universe you've built)",1
"He really does seem like a guy enjoying the hell out of himself that just wants to be the best entertainer while being true to himself. He just wants to make people laugh, and is definitely more on the idealism side of the sliding scale. I feel like modern society lends itself towards more cynical entertainment, and because Fallon is trying to brighten people's day, it comes across as juvenile and very fake. But I think that it's admirable that he just wants more people to smile.",3

Do you think an older film industry professional who hasn't seen the previous films and has little interest would be emotionally moved by Endgame? That is assuming they can look past the overwhelming superhero/action elements and assess it in general as a film.,1

"And the fact that they don't have to make  Made for the trailer  moments. Seriously, go back and watch the first Avengers. The team-up wideshot that was made for the trailer is SO out of place and jarring. I'm so glad they don't have to do that shit anymore.",1

Same here. Thanks OP for not spoiling it (initially). This may very well be the best *teaser* trailer Marvel has released to date. ,3

Thoughts: with the x-men coming out in the next  5 years or or so... i'm ok if they close out spider-man for a bit. just let him end his story in the MCU and sony can do whatever they want. im probably not going to watch the sony spider-man,1
Sony is no fucking better. They are happy to pay game publishers to fuck over consumers that don't have ps4s.,1
I think because this was more of a teaser. I m glad they re not revealing everything in the trailer though. I hate when that happens,3
No nebula and Tony adventure,1

That could be true and that would fit the requirement of it having a larger purpose to the next endgame.,1
"Marvel's power is plot driven. The same person who one shots capital ships gets smacked down by one stone. Her levels are all over the map, that's my biggest complaint about the character.  To be fair, the same argument could be made for most of the MCU. It's just more abrupt with Cap Marvel because it went from one extreme to the other in a few minutes.",1
"Thank you for getting this franchise to where it is today, it wouldn't be the same without you. Loving where the MCU is headed and loving the routes Spidey and Carol are going! Thanks for your time!",1

Odd you should say that. Today I found him hanging out in the background of Randy Newman's music video Short People. At 4:00.

Thanos taking the stone out is what gives Tony the idea of taking the stones not the gauntlet. Tony is the only one in position to do it plus wearing Nano tech armor the same as the gauntlet is what allows him to do it quickly without Thanos noticing.  x200B I find it kind of poetic that Thanos indirectly gave Tony the idea how to beat him when he pulled that cheap move on Carol.,3

Bothof those things came before him trying to hold someone else to something they said 10 years ago is what specifially led to this situation (his firing). He exposed himself to the situation which Disney seemed fine to ignore up until that point.  I don't think he should be fired but I can sure think he is a complete spastic fuck for the way he conducts himself in general.,1
maybe they self replicate. There's only a starter set of nanobots in the chest piece and once activate they rapidly and exponentially create copies made of carbon from the air. To do that you would need to carry a tremendous amount of energy but not mass so it's more believable to me. This is also how I solved the issue of Hulk's mass in my head cannon as he clearly becomes more massive when he's green,2

Which MCU movie have you seen the most times?,1
That tells me absolutely nothing!,1
Hi Kevin! Thank you for all that you've done to make this incredible movie franchise as great as it is. Of all the MCU films which is your favorite and why?,1
"BUT IT WILL BE THE SWEETEST, MOST FLAVORFUL CUP OF PEE OF ALL TIME!",2
Not Another Teen Movie came out in 2001.,1
This trailer didn t do it for me sadly. Something about her voice. Hopefully the movie is good. ,2
Thank You  ,1
"That felt true in the earlier seasons with the deaths of robb and ned, but in the later seasons it feels like big characters only die when it's built up. In the last season a hunting party of all named characters went north of the wall and only one was lost? It feels less like it did. ",2
Nice lol,3
"Hol up, Groot was snapped tho",1
Honestly Ant-man could be anywhere in that trailer.,1
"How much of the 22 films were actually mapped out early on, and how much of them did writers  make fit  into existing story lines forcing others further down the line to adapt?  For instance, was Red Skull's fate set as far back as The First Avenger?",2

"Anybody else think of the end of The Muppet Movie when they see this? Imagine the camera starting close up on RDJ singing  Life s like a movie, write your own ending  and then they all gradually join in as the camera pulls back, and back, and back... ...that would have made me cry just as much as anything in the actual movie.",1
He did? Ok that's cool information if true.,0

That would ve been an awesome tie in. The remaining avengers at Curtis s circle with the punisher. ,3
"You can even see the black goo/smoke stuff that was shown in Hela s portal surrounding the light in both of these. Very cool, adds another power to the omnipotent allfather Odin, who was criminally underutilized in strength and fighting. Atleast they knew to have anthony Hopkins narrate, and deliver some bad ass dialogue.",3
It's over.  It's done.,1
Found Nick Mason's reddit account ( (I'm kidding I love MrSMs too)),2
I wonder if this will be in phase 4 or phase 5. If Thor s going to be in GOTG3 then there s no rush for Thor 4 to be in phase 4. But I m so hyped for this!! Ragnarok was my favorite Thor film so I can t wait to see where Thor goes moving forward!,2
Ooooo I like that. That s some solid sleuthing my dude.,1
Trailers are often released before the final VFX and CGI are completed.  This is most likely the reason.,1
Hey! Thanks for doing this. Doubtful you can answer but do you ever think back to yourself now and go  Wow I am so thankfully Sony didn t buy it all. ? I m a marvel and business fanatic and I just wonder with how often people decide to do this with their own business,1
Who is your favorite character that hasn't made it into the MCU up to this point?,2
Can I just take a moment to point out that they consider Michael  Mary Poppins  Rooker to be a member of the Guardians of the  redacted  Galaxy?,3

I personally don't understand why these guys' opinions matter. I understand what they mean to their respective genres but they mean nothing in the world of superhero movies. So while I see their viewpoint I also don't think it should hold much weight.,1
"I feel like Tony and Nebula are going to use all of their resources to kill Thanos early, leaving the ship without resources and Nebula badly damaged, setting Tony adrift.",1
He's got a TV show coming soon.    Gonna die at least three times in the first season lol.,1

Sokovia is honestly the only example of them being at fault and minimizing their own damage. But putting NY and Hydra 2.0 at their feet was unfair but very believable. It's what people would do. ,1

"I dunno, he s gonna be in that film but like is that then going to be his last appearance in the MCU?  I mean if that s the case maybe marvel and Sony could make a deal so they can use Miles in the MCU and Peter in sony verse or something. I think the best case scenario would be Feige producing the spider verse films as part of the MCU.",1

"I see what you're saying. This movie is of monolithic proportions, probably something that's never been done before. So many characters, back stories, etc. and trying to fit them all in to a movie anything less than 3 hours is going to be tough. ",1
Could avengers 5 ever happen?,1
"RIP, Stan. Thanks for making me a True Believer. Excelsior.  Nuff. Said.",1
"Hi Mr. Feige, thank you so much for doing this.  While I know you cant answer about any future plans, what is your opinion on the state of Daredevil and the other Netflix MCU shows in the MCU canon?

Including the video liked by OP, which has 872 thousand views, that s a total of about 3.9 million views. That s a lot of people who have watched the video.",1
Well that was underwhelming ,1

Had they had known they could've iced him before getting the soul stone so he doesnt try to escape and kill millions of lives..",2
"Endgame is better. IW is nice and all, but it s not Endgame.",2
Agreed. This is the one they should have gone with instead of the Conan O Brien  do we got.,3
"Yeah. Personally, I like black panther only cuz of his thing in civil war. It was better than his own movie. The best thing is where he is OP (human level) , maybe as strong as cap but he never outshines Cap.",3

"Noh, nowy tends.",1
"Deflecting is very different than holding, you're arguing semantics. Thor can't just place the hammer in someone's hand, like let's say Clint's and then say  oh he didn't lift it, he's just holding it . No its gonna drop",0
And most recently threatened the life of Robert Mueller,2
"Hi Kevin! First things first - thank you for the care and passion you put into bringing our MCU to life. I feel invested in these characters all over again!

Dude. Holy fucking shit this is incredible. No joke I was blown away watching this. You have serious talent!,1
disney has to make a deal with universal and sony for that,1

"There was a rumor VERY early on from some Disney insiders that said the Mouse was just waiting for the Fox Merger to go through before rehiring Gunn (essentially not wanting to piss off anyone in the government and fuck the deal up by supporting such a vocal critic of the president).  So with the merger 5 days away from closing with all the necessary approvals needed, as well as the confirmation that he was reinstated on the down low months ago...seems like there was some definite validity to the rumor.",2

I don't go to Marvel films for a sad fuckin story it's about mythologising and heroics. I don't know how you read my comment and took from it that I think Black Widow should be funny.

BW should have a similar tone,1

What's with the ballerinas? How does this tie in to previous movies? At least this one builds from where the other movies leave off, and the theme of invasion/destruction/despair is pretty consistent across the board. So hyped. But now I will ignore the rest of the trailers that come out, as I'm sure they will begin to spoil things.",1

Strange isn't omnipotent. He only can know about things he has access too. The better question is why, before IW, he hadn't already used the time stone to look into the possible futures?",1
"I honestly don't want them to do it this way, it's such a cheap move. I think they should do it like this:   They've always existed, but have never been a large enough group to be acknowledged, they have mostly become myths in the ancient times, and in more recent times just been covered up by sheild or something. That way we can still have Magneto's awesome background, we can get people like Apocalypse too.",1

That's what I though too lol,1

Off to the great cameo in the sky. This day extracts a heavy toll  ,1
His dad told him he had a nutsack chin,3
"Took me a while, but I think he's joking about gamoras green hand holding Thanos'",3
"I get what you did here but context matters. Rosanne was CURRENTLY tweeting that. Gunn did his 10 years ago. Sticks and stones and time. He didn't kill someone.  He made bad jokes.  Those were there (and reviewed) before his hire. This isn't right, no matter how you spin it.",1
They really don t though. They signed contracts. If they quit then Disney can sue for breach of contract. ,2
"Careful, you are around slobbering fanboys. ",1
Probably because this is the absolute peak of what the MCU can possibly achieve and they achieved it amazingly,1
YOU ARE A BLESSING TO THIS THREAD. Now I know what my computer wallpaper will be for the next 6 months,2

You again  ,2

Hi Kevin! First off I want to thank you for being such a great model for me and other people that want to pursue a carreer arround entretainment. 1- What is the first tip or lesson you would give to someone that wants to be a producer? 2- What is a great mistake that people should avoid in these carreers?,1
Cap running at the very front like a true leader.. next to BP. Just great.,1
Was Banner looking at the faces of who was snapped? Because how would they know Spider-Man was dusted??? ,1
So where did Cap find his WS suit? Didn t he get rid of it in the gym in CATWS? (deleted scene),1
RIP. You created some of my favorite superheroes therefore making you the real superhero. ,1
Been there done that  He s just another person who has addiction problems  Just like Steve o Your not a good person cause your sober  Your sober cause your a good person is how it should be ,0
Hmm...that's not how casting works,0

"I've never watched a single Avengers movie, just never was that into any of those heroes compared to X-Men (yes I know those movies are very lacking) ***but this scene does look quite bad-ass***.  Perhaps a weekend I've got nothing better to do I'll try to get through them.",1
Sony: Let's make a universe about Spider-Man supporting characters without any Spider-Man in it!,3
Or the under verse.,1
"Honestly disappointed. I want more content. Pretty simple. Obviously the Mandalorian season isn't over yet, but it's probably gonna feel short. And then we may have 2 years before season 2? It's gonna be a long wait.",1
Lucky motherflerker,1
"Regarding your first paragraph, yes and that's OK. If Disney agreed to split also merchandise then it would have made more sense. Like this is just Sony giving them their part with nothing in return. Second paragraph: you pay nothing. Sony is more than happy to fund the movies and keep all the profit.",1
Not a big deal but would it be possible to touch up some scenes from previous movies involving Thanos? Make him look more consistent to his appearance in Infinity War/Endgame. Thank you for all your work!,1
You re amazing!!!!,0
Thor 4: Ragnarok 2: Asgardians of the Galaxy,3
Oh that. Thanks,1
He split an incoming arrow in 2 - I would consider this to actually be impressive,1
And Jeff goldbloom!:-),1
 Get this man a shield!  has a very John Wick 2 vibe to it...,1
Not a bad way to retire. Stardew Valley is pretty addictive. ,1
"Hi Kevin, After having such a smashing success with the MCU do you ever feel that whatever big thing is next to come, could be hard to surpass what you ve already created? A similar example of this recently was Masahiro Sakurai having made Super Smash Ultimate, a culmination of everything he s made. He feels that it s going to be hard to trope, and with the MCU being as successful as it is, I m curious if you ever have that similar feeling? Thank you!",1
Not to mention Bones in Star Trek and Dredd... he is a true Rennaisance Man,3
He looks like Marc Meron in GLOW!,1
"I mean just because they grew tired doesn't mean they didn't enjoy it. Hemsworth felt like he had no room to grow in his role, but that's obviously changed. RDJ spent 1.5 decades in basically a single role, and I'm sure he wants to slow down. Chris Evans wants to explore new directions.",3
SO WERE NOT JUST GONNA PRETEND WE DIDN T SEE TEENAGER GROOT ,1
"I like it, the taste of it.... ",1
The actors of the MCU are like a brotherhood in which they all root hard for each other even if they had nothing to do with the others project.  It s a shame these guys and girls can t play these roles forever. ,1

It was just a matter of time before they worked things out. Too much money at stake. The next Spiderman instantly lost its must see status when I left the MCU. Glad to have Spiderman back in the MCU!,1
What is finally! a jeopardy category I could beat my parents at?,1
Should've replaced all the names with Jeremy Renner and have one Paul Rudd. ,3
Reminds me of that meme captioned something like When you hold up your finger to tell Tony  wait a minute so Captain Marvel can get up and defeat Thanos  but he just goes and kills himself instead ,1
"Actually hadn't considered that, but that sounds fairly plausible.",1
Poor Tom Holland. He is still a kid. He must have felt devastated.,3
People dont understand basic probability and assume that because something ended up happening that it MUST have been the most likely outcome.,1
Difficulties such as these were going to happen sooner or later.,1
"Wait wait.  Is this an old message?  With the time travel theory, does Cap say this in the past and Lang is there somehow meeting up with them through the quantum realm?",1
"Thanks, your sacrifice has spared me from spoilers.",3
"Well,  and the helicarrier in AoU.    But I get you lol",2
Night Monkey will save them all.,3

They freakin did it!,1
Got a feeling... Gamora... hope I am wrong.  ,1
"Not to mention that Johns is the president at DC (while Kevin is president at Marvel Studios).  Edit: never mind, he  *was * until last year.",3

"There was some news some months ago that Stan did like 4-5 film cameos already, he is gonna be in next Avengers and Captain Marvel for sure, maybe even next Spider Man",3
How much?,1
Marvel never really completely reboots anything. They just... Shake things up every year or two and give new status quos for heroes and release a bunch of  1's. DC reboots are like a brand new coffee made from scratch while Marvels soft reboots are like adding cream to coffee. Ultimately still the same liquid but with a different appearance.,2
Given Thanos that quality bamboozle ,1
oh shit what is up my son,1
No it was never confirmed to be him in the 1st one. ,2
 Full version officially released by Marvel (url),3
That come out of fucking nowhere,1
" I think I had a life here. And everything fell into place: - Why they are starting the story with her already in the Kree Military - How they can do a fish out of water story on Earth with someone from Earth. - Why they say her power will be balanced by her humanity, or more succinctly,  what's her damage ? *Trauma*, man, you can't be an Avenger without it. Unless you are Hawkeye.",1
"ikr.  looked like she was finally starting to age a bit in IW, but all her footage from the endgame marketing looks like its sending her right back to Lost in Translation",3

This is like as a kid when you would dump out all your favorite super heroes and have them fight together in one big war in your living room. ,1

"Big problem with Spidey in Civil War and Homecoming. They had perfect fine practical suits, but replaced them completely with poor cgi, even when he s standing still.",2
"I was so hoping Hope would pull a Giant man move, grow huge and double team thanos' ship.",1
"He hasnt been living in solitary for 1500 years. Nobody elses attitude has influenced him. It was a gradual change, it was sudden. The Thir we saw in AoU was the same Thor as the previous films. Ragnarok was a complete 180.",1
"Nevermind! I suck at typing, it comes up when you actually manage to spell it right.",1
It's a joke. Relax.,1
/r/getsbettereveryloop,1
Anthony Bourdain? That's a bit harsh.,1
Go Go! You will have my support!,1
I care so much about all of these characters' fates.  I was 17 when this all began.  It's just awesome to have such a deep connection.  It's all full circle.  I'm nutting full circle.  ,1
"I watched it twice. It wasn't easier, I just noticed more disturbing content",1
  WHO THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS,1
"RIP. Honestly, he seemed unhappy his last few years, with all the abuse, so I'm almost relieved for him. ",3
I m making a note here: Huge Success!,1
Since it was more or less the exact same scene in Thor 3 i didn't even raised one of my eyebrowns.,1
Meanwhile the movie crew afraid of spoilers of Tom Holland to the kids  ,1
"One thing I don't understand is how they intend to cross over Venom with Tom Holland's Spider-Man. Is Tom Holland going to play a different version of Spider-Man? Or is Venom an MCU movie? Because in Venom, people are unfamiliar with the reality of aliens.",1
i've never seen a gif look so goregeous,1
"Hey Kevin, love you and your vision. How do you feel about the homecoming  8 years later  continuity error?",1
Gotta get those hero shots in the movie.,3
And a cheeseburger. Get me a cheeseburger first.,2
"I'm so excited to have Coulson back on the big screen. A man with such conviction. With all the knowledge of what becomes of him in Agents of SHIELD, it's so much more exciting. ",3
Original Cap was a dude wasn t he? ,1
"You're comparing a demolition derby to NASCAR and pretending people don't know the difference.   People know the difference between real wrestling and WWE.  It turns out real wrestling is pretty fucking boring, that's why  real  wrestlers quit after high school unless they were good enough to go Olympic and the WWE pulled in 50 million in profits in 2016 alone.  ",2
God damn cap is wholesome,3
Nothing is impossible if you have them stones! ,3
"Again, I said it could probably be explained but it s messy. We need to make too many assumptions and can t know for sure and we need to come up with theories because the movies were inconsistent with it.  That s all. It s a huge franchise. There s bound to be a few flaws (and there s plenty) but it s still remarkably solid and incredible. I love the MCU.",1
Reminder that they were playing Fortnite in this scene,3
Zewan EmcGregor?,3
You know there was time back around 2012 when Carol would've gone through half those hairstyles in a single month. She had the most inconsistent hair from book to book at Marvel for the longest time you'd swear it was secondary power in its own right.,1
Would be rad if it's 1st of April,1
"Completely tasteless. Yesterday when I check Reddit, we were all supporting him.  I wake up, open Reddit, and now people are discussing if he's faking it. It's so shitty",1
I don't go to Taco Bell for Mexican food. I go to Taco Bell for Taco Bell.,3
Oh man I didn't even think of that. I know they are pulling straight from source comics with the helmet but damn they look similar and I would bet the costume designer was happy to go for such a similar look.,3
I 100  thought before IF they were going to kill Scarlett Witch to make Hulk going super rage mode. But they kind of scraped that whole storyline.   There is an element of rage to Hulk that they just ignored and it really bummed me out.,1
I pray with whatever God you believe in that you get to see End Game. ,1
Oh I needed this happy news today! Hell yes!,1
That s rad,1
"WB ruined Justice league from the start by shoehorning in Batman and Wonder woman into MOS2, and then fucking killing Superman. Don't blame Whedon for trying to pick up the pieces. ",1
He has some sort of technological device that allows him to walk when he wears it or something like that. Without it he can t walk tho. ,2
Wait is that Tony Stark next to Nebula? Does that mean he survives?,1
"They are still probably valid laws, but they don't get enforced, because no one gives a shit anymore.  Cap is back living in society while BW is heading up what's left of the Avengers, despite both of them being literal fugitives from the law. It could be written off that public opinion is that the Avengers could've protected them, but the Accords played a role in them not being able to do so effectively.",2
"Somebody call an ambulance, this guy is having a stroke! ",2
Uwe Boll is also retired (just found out that one myself) and has been since 2016.  The German tax money he was  laundering  spending on films dried up.,1
I could 100  see this and I'm actually okay with it,1
Has any actor you worked with made you star struct? if so who?,1
Yeah true,2
Ok that's better,2
tEChnIcaLLy HE's aN ArAChnId,3
"Scott says  I'm Scott, we met a few weeks ago.  Bruce,  is this an old message? ",0
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with these jokes...,2
Daredevil and Punisher just aren t really necessary for Marvel lore. They re street level standalone heroes.,1
I hate this time line,1
"Wtf, I almost exited out of the tab. Forgot Marvel always throws something in at the end.",1
What if the last scene in the house takes place pre-Battle for New York when they go to bring The Avengers together? It still works if we presume that Cap met Lang previously during WW2. You know... in Germany. Time Travel can be fun shit. Even better if its Lang's future and Cap's past.,0
"Oh man, that moment when he gets home and finds out Cassie is dusted is going to be RAW for those dads out there",3
Where s my dude Ant-man?,1
Mar-Vell was a good guy though and the source of Carol's powers. I really hope they don't fuck with that.,2
Fucking truth. ,2
Not until Feige say they aren't.,2
I really hope one day we get this scene https://i.imgur.com/wkHVEnU.jpg,1
"Is it just me or are all of their costumes much darker now? Even the Vanity Fair cover. It's mostly all black, with some reds. ",1
You lost man. It s over. ,2

Bruh a month of Disney + costs less than a single movie ticket what are u complaining about,1
 Part of the journey is the end.   I really hope you get to see it.,3

"This will get buried. But, with ant man at the gate, the leafs are on the floor all scattered, the chain on the gate is rusted.. it feeels like it's been a fair bit of time passing before he comes back",1
I havnt seen any of your work before but now im trolling through all your old posts. These are great.,1
"Aquaman and Shazam! were solid movies. I didn't see wonder woman. I only saw parts of the various Superman garbage fires and the squad one. Downside for the DCEU is that Shazam! was meant to be a one-off I think? Or at least the novelty that made it so good wouldn't be there for a sequel, so they'd need more than that.",1
Hey where is Spider-man?,1
I remember this post credits scene showed Strucker as a menancing villain and I was excited when I heard the actor who played him signed on for a multi movie deal..... lol whatever happened to that,1
"Out of curiousity, which is your favourite Superhero Mr Feige? :)",1
this is how i ve imagined it in my head. during marvel logo intro we hear a man crying then hard cut to clint sitting in a gloomy-ass house all alone looking at a picture of his family,2
"So you just put scenes together that can make transitions that flow, even if it looks stupid and make no sense? Why?",0
"I think this is a bit of a cop out, his powerset is completely different from Doc Strange. He's exclusively using telekinesis and not once does he exhibit any other type of power or  sorcery  over the two movies.",1

> got I see what you did there.,2
"Were there any plans for nebula/gamora to kill thanos? I loved the way he died but I definitely wanted to see nebula get her revenge, but I do like that she was more worried about saving her sister than killing her father.",2
I watched it the other night so I have an advantage.  I decided to rewatch most of them last week.,1
"Not sure about that. I have a feeling they re going to wrap up his story nicely, and then bring him to the Sonyverse.",0
"Your plan sucks, I can t wait for them on screen together",1
"It's all over the internet at this point, we know the next nine movies just not the order they are going to be released in.",1
"I was wonder how they are gonna top the usual circling shot of the Avengers, and damn they basically circled around every fucking heroes in the MCU (no love for AOS and Defenders though booo). I can still hear Steve's  AVENGERS...! *Assemble*  in my head feisty ofdisuofhduso",1
Thanks for probably the greatest movie saga of my life! What hero or villain do you still wish you could ve brought to life on screen?,1
Surprised this is so far down. It was the first thing I noticed and happened as the first kneel.,1
...all part of Mysterio s **long con**,1
"My only complaint is after Thanos was beating the shit out of Cap and cracked his shield in half he didnt stand up with the classic,  I could do this all day. ",1
Holy shit! I saw CM last night and was not prepared for that. It was beautiful and heartbreaking. ,3
I like how Pratt s is functional but simple. I don t know him but it s consistent with how he presents himself. ,1
"The Black Order are Thanos's henchmen, you see all four of them just before Thanos crushes the Tessaract. There's a huge, bulky monster guy (Cull Obsidian), there's a scary female assassin type woman (Proxima Midnight), there's a magical illusion guy (Ebony Maw), and then there's their fearless/evil leader (Corvus Glaive). They really feel to me like an evil reflection of certain Avengers members, with a Hulk/Drax-ish one, a Black Widow-ish one, a Dr Strange/Scarlet Witch-ish one, and a Cap-type fighter guy",3
We won Mr Stark,1
Antman reveals so much though.  What he bring back from the quantum realm is the key to this whole thing as we expected.,1
"Great video, u think when FFH comes out on DVD, you can redit it with those scenes...?",1
Okay sorry. ,2
Shrunken Hulk riding an arrow and then resizing while inside the wound.,1
Hopefully Keanu plays Adam Warlock. That would be something special.,1
I'm on pc and I see a box as well. What is the comment?,1
I think you get to pick one movie for each terminal cancer you have. So you've probably got a couple selections left even after captain marvel and endgame.,3

This looks awesome! And it looks like they are treating her like a hero who happens to be a woman rather than just shoving girl power in your face! I am so juiced for this!,1
The likelihood of that getting through regulators in multiple countries especially after the Fox merger is incredibly unlikely.,2
With the Disney+ I kinda expected this but also expected them to pick up... Marvel has a home there it would only make since they should move but cancel not.,1
I've been saying that since first seeing Endgame.  Apparently they thought about bringing the Netflix characters in during that moment too.,2
how do we know this?,1
"Ok, missed that point but Jon is such a legend, is he the first director to star and direct a MCU film",1
I cant get you to a screening but I'd donate part of my liver and marrow if we matched,3
I really hope they call it Th4,1
Thank you for everything I honestly didn't know how much of an impact you had on my childhood until my brother called me an said dude did you hear Stan Lee died? Thank you for spider man and EVERYTHING else!!! Rest In Peace ,1
"I mean that s pretty subjective. Personally I believe this is the best live action spidey film adaptation. Everyone is allowed their opinions though, and since Far From Home is the highest grossing Spider-Man movie and got rave reviews and fan reactions. I think a lot of people like them too.",2
"I lost a good friend of mine from high school. She was 31 (I'm 32) when she passed away last year from Hodgkin lymphoma (stage 4). I went to her memorial service and got to meet her mother as well as see my old high school friends whom I haven't seen in years but yeah, I hope we can help this guy see Endgame before he passes away. By the way, cancer fuckings sucks!",1
It looks like the portal Thanos steps out of is similar to the one Hela appeared out of in Thor. Maybe they are connected? ,1
"I think Deadpool 2 was meh but better than most non-MCU super hero films.    I expect Black Widow to deliver the same feeling.  Also I've never been into the character.  That being said ...

Excellent!! Ragnarok was by far the best Thor movie by a lightyear. I m excited for this and happy to hear our boy Chris Hemsworth isn t done with the MCU. It sounds like he ll be in Guardians 3 then Thor 4 after that. This is great news!!!,1
Wanda: :D,1
And it was in theaters for literally years.,1

That would be an interesting doll set.,3

Could also double as Angus McFife,1
I just wanna say how fucking heartwarming it is to see reddit rally together for this guy. I see alot of negativity thrown into threads but not here and it's refreshing. NOW LETS GET TRUE BELIEVER  HIS MOVIE! I LOVE ALL YOU PEOPLE ,1
"I mean, we've been airbrushing model shots for, like, ever. So covering up a scar would have been a matter of course no matter who did the photo shoot...",3
Came-ohno.,1
The name of this movie itself is a money maker. Now you will have to mention the highest grossing movie of all time when ever another big Budget block buster hit the big screens.,1
I've heard he comes in through a portal with Ravagers n Howard the Duck,2
Does anyone know what that giant machine Thor is using is?,1
Notice Cap is wearing some Wakandan gloves,1
"Yeah, some lines sound really off to me too.",1
He s doing his best ,3
"There is an apology from 2012 for an article he wrote called  50 Superheroes You Most Want to Have Sex With,  but I haven't seen any past apologies about the pedophilia jokes/tweets.",1
I don t know... there seems to be nothing remotely risky on Disney+. The riskiest thing on Disney+ is The Simpsons. Nothing treads close to Rated R content.  I also think that if Disney is going to completely focus on the MCU that they wouldn t give access to superhero movies that don t tie with the MCU.,2
Am I losing my mind or is that Mjolnir?,1
"They re referring to people saying James is an actual pedophile and rapist.  And they agree that they were inappropriate jokes, the cast isn t defending the jokes he made. ",1
"Awww, it s hideous.",1
It looks like something out of Lord of the Rings and I want it so badly.,0
Plus he needs to rebuild Asgard and become the new Allfather. Lots of loose ends left in his story arc.,1
Good choice.,1
Disney needs to create this into a show. Like now. This art looks amazing I want to see it move.,1
 Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze! (url),2
Scott:  It doesn't do so well to Marvel Studios...remember what that Endgame did? ,2
"Blockbuster might have peaked at it's popularity in the late 90's, but I could be wrong about that. I definitely used it till it went out of business well into the 00's.  I was just making a stupid joke because I thought it was funny for the opening shot to be a Blockbuster.",1
"I liked it, nicely non-traditional the further you get in.",1
I think he just wanted to start a global race war,3

"Oh yeah, they'd definitely sit down with his doctors or something.",3
Wayyyy better than the cover arts we got.,1
 Still super pissed that movie dropped out and was replaced by a horrible TV show. ,1
"Good way to blow off steam. Plus, if you do something professionally, you never really stop practicing. Kobe Bryant was out there taking like 1500 shots before every game. ",1
also to my understanding it might be one of the first movies that are full in color or something about using the first technology in color in the movie,1
"Lol, Universal starting their change public opinion on a Back to the future reboot.  Collider is awful.",3

 So we are using our made up names  heheh,1
This guy team builds. ,3
As long as Nebula survives. I want her to be there at the final battle against Thanos.,2
We're all standing up now.,1

Still no sign of Thanos. I m digging the mystery. Also-- Captain Marvel :D,1
Tom lookin nice in that tight suit.,1

Stupid post,1
Wrong. Sony has made it pretty clear they are moving forward with Spidey in their universe.,0
Maybe he ll appear in Doctor Strange and get lost in the multiverse,3

I wonder if Thor is as strong as Captain Marvel.,1
Why not just show *her* story from *her* perspective?,2
"Iron Man 3, Avengers 2, Thor 2.",1
Very cool cosplay!!,1
Thor had done lots wrong.  Being worthy isn't the same as being perfect.  That makes no fucking sense.,3
"scarjo saying to marvel:  fine, i'll do it myself ",3
"I m about 4-5 comments down into a thread. If I was looking for attention, this isn t where I d be. You are the one bitching about other people expressing grief. To top that you act like a child with your  ok this is epic . Don t get me wrong, Ben Shapiro memes are hilarious, but that must be the shittiest use of that yet. Not ironic, not well put, not funny, just used to make yourself look like an asshole.",0
why the only person not facing left is captain marvel?,1
Snowpiercer is a graphic novel. I think the guy who played Vison is the same guy who played the lead in Priest also a graphic novel.,1
A group of Skrulls fighting each other,1
I was wondering who that was,1
A hell of a legacy to leave behind though. ,1
"They could change his backstory slightly. They've already established that through Zemo, Sokovia had death squads so Magneto could have been persecuted by them?",2
Have you ever shot a cow with a rocket launcher? Be sure vietnam is on your list. ,1
"Lol true. I wasn't even thinking about the set being actually in the desert, it seemed like they were talking in universe.  That would be hot as hell, wearing essentially a black sweater and sweats in the desert + hard plastic",1
I would lose my fucking shit if that happened. They did something similar in the post-credits scene of Into The Spiderverse and it was hilarious.,1
I completely lost it at Bandit as Rocket.,2
Ok but why is avatar the highest grossing movie who watched it,0
"Its a flying suit, incredibly mobile and with defensive capabilities, most notably force fields. She'd do fine avoiding a killing blow from a leviathan. And honestly you're missing the best possible use of rescue -- controlling and transporting the infinity gaunlet.",1
Don't need no infinity stones for that.,2
That isn t really the same thing though,3
That will probably be in the HISHE.,3
"Honestly, I had to google it when 36 was referenced as middle aged.   I always thought of middle aged as 40s-50s.  Good to know that was along the right lines I guess.",1
 >I ve heard rumors that the next big villain is gonna be galactus the planet eater Certainly not to be trusted rumour. I am willing to bet farm Marvel will not touch Galactus for a while.,1
"All I'll say, and all you need to say is this: The Russo brothers made it to THE TOP and they didn't have to attack other films to get there. Stay salty, sore losers!",0
"Hi Kevin! First off, thank you for your help in creating such an awesome cinematic universe! Just want to hear from you if you can confirm if Sony will continue to partner with Marvel Studios to have Spider-Man in the MCU. So far, we haven't heard the future of Spider-Man past Far From Home. Please let us know if we can expect more Spider-Man MCU movies and appearances! Thanks!",1
If he didnt do that he would be racist ,1

What was your favorite cameo in Endgame?,1
Thank you Dave.,1
"Hey Kevin, how do you guys go about making sure that each of the movie's style and atmosphere is similar to all the other movies in the MCU? Do you have a hand in overseeing character or set design to make sure each one flows with other characters seen in-universe? Thanks!",1
"Oh, sorry, I mean resources as in counselling and stuff devoted to helping people cope. I'm assuming if it's a few years later there'd be less in the way of support groups because people will have somewhat recovered.",3
"This was awesome, the wait was worth it",1
Hi Kevin I have a question us about the soul World soul stone will we learn more about who are connected to it like Gamora and Adam Warlock  in the comics?,1
I stand corrected! Good detective work.,1
"Oh definitely. They've treated the MCU as a separate universe from the start, and it is absolutely the best way to do it. As long as they want to keep this going, giving us good stories and characters true to the spirit of the comics, I'm on board.",1
"The *ONLY* criticism I have about Endgame, is that (for me) the  Avengers Assemble!  line feels so out of place, they're all already assembled behind him.",0
"How about in light of Stan Lee's passing, Deadpool took over the cameo spot in each MCU movie? He could do some break the 4th wall stuff, just be seen in the background doing random stuff.",1
"I kind of agree with this one. I find it hard picturing him in the midst of the other grounded characters, in a way that doesn't make me a little uneasy",1
"I know, right? May better discipline him.",1
"They really kept that chin, huh",1
"Not exactly, Nicole Perlman did and it became the foundation of what Gunn developed what we ended up seeing. He rewrote it enough though that he got sole credit in the end I believe, (EDIT:) I can't remember if she got credited in the film though.",1
Where s Nakia? Is she dead? Alive? Secret mission? ,1
They did it with Spider-Man. They can do it with X-Men. Just as long as it's nothing like Dark Phoenix.,1
Do you guys recommend seeing this movie? I heard it's decent but nothing exceptional- why has it grossed so much?,1
Shut up Lana,2
A timeline where Thor went for the head right away,1
Any more plans for the hulk?,1
that sounds hot,3
"I would include Strange's reaction (but not the kneeling) right after the cut to Cap and Thor. That way you have the reactions of the key figures in Tony's life (Pepper, Rhodes, Peter Parker, Cap, Thor, and Strange, the man who set the final stage of Tony's life/arc)",1
Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubber band Man,2
Least I can offer you is a silver...wish I had more coins,1

You can be dark and be PG. The Dark Knight wasn't Rated R.,0
Remember when Andrew Garfield's Spider-man leapt over a massive fence when the bell rang in front of buidlings filled with people? Me neither. Both have their faults sometimes but the thing I'll give credit to in ASM 2 is that when Peter's Garfield that mask stays on.,1
Man they showed a lot of Spider-Man getting his ass beat. Go easy on the kid!,1
Years ago I sat saddened by the fact that Spider-Man was separated from Marvel. Today I see peter Parker fighting along side Tony stark and getting choke slammed by the Mad Titan Thanos. This is **the** best time to be alive for a comic book fan.,2
"Take to Twitter, the probably respond to Twitter.",3
"You should probably look at the climax of *Superman: The Movie*, where Kal-El throws a nuke into space, and then watch the ending of *The Avengers* again. That wasn't a coincidence, it was a love letter to the superhero movie that set the mold for pretty much everything that has followed.",3
Dude... I'll give you a 3 Gunn solute for that comment.,1

He talked like a god at the end of Age of Ultron and has after that until Ragnarok not been on earth again yet at the very beginning of Ragnarok he sounds even dumber than Peter Quill who grew up on earth.,1
Now I feel like Captain is going to be in Black Panther!,1
Any chance we will see Inhumans in upcoming movies?,1
Into the Spiderverse and Endgame both established independently that a multiverse exists.  It wouldn't break canon in any way for characters to move between one universe and the other.,1

Hoes mad,1
*** Outstanding move. ***,3
More like he is back after Thor Ragnarok. ,2
"Ohhh thankss.. And one more thing i was thinking about is that thanos must have seen dr. strange's communication thru nebula, where he talks about winning in only one future and 'this was the only way'.. Then why did he still tried to kill the population? Couldn't he have guessed that in 'that' future he is going to lose because dr. strange was supposed to guard the time stone and he gave it to him willingly??",1
"Point taken (this was leveled as criticism against captain marvel in Endgame) I have to say though, in Captain Marvel s issue is mostly her absence from the plot in contrast with her power. If she was involved more personally i think her power level would not necessarily be as much of an issue.",1

I hope I don't get cheated from that brief scene between Cap and Wanda,1
Forget the Infinity Saga... MCU phase 1-3 is the Tony Stark saga. IM 2 is kinda skippable that way but Iron Man 3 might just be the most important movie they made. It bridges the distance between Phase 1 and Phase 2-3 Tony.,2

"Endgame makes the most sense, considering AoU and IW namedrops it. It might seem awkward right now but it'll grow on you. There wasn't really any title that would've worked tbh, it was a weirs spot to be in. Maybe A3 should've been called Infinity Gauntlet and A4 would be Infinity War? ",1
"Dude, go read any Guardians comic before the movie came out and changed the game for the entire franchise. It may be very loosely rooted in it, but make no mistake, the Guardians films are far more Gunn than they are Marvel.",0

"I m a bit worried you re right, it s the kind of thing Thanos would do. Maybe a second or two of pause, something like  too late Asgardian  and bam, dead Loki. I don t want him to die, like I really don t, but there are almost certainly going to be major character deaths here, and as far as I know this is Hiddleston s last guranteed contracted filmmas Loki.

I earned that cry goddamnit. 11 years comprised of countless hours of happiness culminated in that moment and I'm not embarrassed to admit it was overwhelming.",2

No one saw this coming,1
"Well, technically you can travel through time if you can travel through space. I think it'll be too complicated for the show to use it (and risk making the Tesseract too OP), but if you do the math right you can time travel by space travelling.  More likely, I think he trades the space stone for time stone. Mr. H said something that might hint towards that, the stone is green (his colour), and it appeared to be in the logo reveal.",1

Yeah weight is super hard to get right and they aren't selling it here.,1
"Something that always bugged me about Infinity War -- Cap's little mini shields. When he either should have had the energy shield, like he had for a bit in the comics, or gone back to the original triangle, just for a fun callback.",1
It would be nice in addition to him calling the film a  theme park ride  that he recognized the talent and work that was poured into the films and added they re just not for him.,2

Both Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson are older than me and their faces scream nostalgia that I don't think Pokemon would bring if they weren't that familiar with it.",1
If there was a Nova film in development...would it be with Richard Rider?,1
Iron Doctor and Strange Man,3
"I reckon it'll be Rocket. I posted it above and I'm likely wrong, but this is my theory:  Rocket was absent in the trailer, but we know he survived. Rocket does not know however that the the rest of Guardians also turned to dust. He'll leave Earth (somehow) and track the Guardians ship to find whoever 'survived', only to stumble upon Nebula and Tony. ",1
"I ve always seen the movies in the MCU more as episodes in a series rather than whole, self-contained movies. The 15th episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender doesn t make too much sense without understanding the story of the previous 14 episodes.  Yeah, if you skip all of the MCU and just watch Ragnarok, you re not gonna understand a lot. But I think the MCU is a pretty special case and it s better for not explaining everything in every movie. Makes more room for movies to do their own thing. ",3

"Hey, Kevin! Why is Gamora?",1
"Unfortunately they had to rush a lot of Carols story and character development to fit her into Endgame. They filmed infinity war, Captain Marvel, and Endgame pretty much all at the same time. Carol Danvers is an awesome character, but you need more time to flesh that out and get the audience to understand that.",1
"SO, Is Nova confirmed for Guardians 3? Is Beta Ray Bill going to make an appearance in phase 4? Do Gamora and Thor join the Guardians? Is Spider-Man taking on the role of TS?

"That hurts, his work has impacted my life so much. Especially as someone who doesn t have very many role models in their life superheroes are kind of special to me and it sucks knowing that the person who created/co-created most of my favorite fictional characters is dead.

"So are skrulls confirmed?  I haven't been following news of the movie at all, but after seeing her punch an old lady in the face all I can think is: Yep, that has to be a damn Skrull ",1

If you not a gamer getting a console just for one game would be an overkill imo. Just look for JJJ highlights on youtube or watch a whole gameplay.

You're arguing against a fan and you're being downvoted by fans. Your points are all well-reasoned. Don't think for a second that you're being downvoted because English is a foreign language.

"Disney gets the Merch rights pretty much no matter what so it's not really relevant. You're looking at it from a Sony perspective, but what about a Disney one? Disney can make this movie with Sony, and earn  50mil. Now what if instead of making this movie, they made a different movie? They could easily spend the time on something else and make more than 50mil. Why make a movie with Sony?",1

I hope the movie is good. But this trailer didn't do a lot for me.,1
I wish you and yours all the best. I am so happy you got this wish. Take care.,1

"I understood  cinema  here as a general body of cinematic works. Sorry if this meaning doesn't fall under this word, it does in my mother tongue, so I assumed it also works in English. Maybe that's a mistake on my part.  MCU movies sometimes graze upon surfaces of such explorations, but they never go any deep (cause that's not their point, and that's ok), and the extent and the form is what makes the distinction in my opinion.",1

> It's something like this that will really test Disney. Who said the Disney name will even be associated with it? They might just keep the Fox branding as a completely separate entity just so they can make R rated films that Disney doesn't want to be associated with.,1
"**Hi Kevin,** I just wanted to say how much I love your passion for marvel. Its so inspiring and intriguing how much effort and work you put into this amazing franchise. x200B I was wondering if you could talk about the X-MEN, I know you can't say much.

Nothing is wrong with them. Sony owns the movie rights to Spiderman. Last 2 movies were made in conjunction with Disney/Marvel. Now Disney/Marvel wants the profits to be 50/50. Sony said no.

So basically it's setting up mutants right. Cause mutants are the next stage of human  evolution . Honestly can't say am surprised by this whole scoop. Maybe it's  me but I heard this type of rumours alot already and at this point it might as well be fact that this movie will set up a lot of new concepts and may serve as the true kick off for the next phase of mcu movies.,2

The scene showing nebula is in a ship and if you look at the background it is just like from the opening Tony scene. Or maybe I'm just speculating way too much,1
What ?,1
What did I miss why does vision look like a real human??,1
Scorpion?,1
"I m not sure you re allowed to have that opinion. You either love it or you re a bigot it seems. Oh, also a neck beard. It seems they go hand in hand?",1
Better than  can I speak to the manager  from endgame,1
Does it mean anything that thanos was struggling with captain America? ,1
How is there 1.6k comments and no upvotes guys come on,1
"Seems the artist of this credited Florey on their DA, but yeah, I saw this and thought  I'm sure I saw this over a year ago, but it was neater ",1
"What s the plan for the next saga, we just finished the Infinity Saga, what s next? Who s the next main villain, Kang the Conquerer, Doctor Doom, Galactus?",2
Amazing!  Great makeup!   And pretty too,1
Ragnarok was awesome because it rewrote Thor's character and Bruce Banner. I hated Bruce before Thor. He always felt a little one dimensional.,0
"If you don t already work as an editor in Hollywood, you bloody well should do.  Incredible. Bravo  ",0
Can we please have a movie that doesn't revolve around him.,2
Damn these onion-cutting hydra-ninjas,1
"Spectacle -  an event or scene regarded in terms of its visual impact. The draw of Avatar was seeing Pandora in 3D.  It had a shit story and forgettable characters.   Endgame has a ton of memorable and enjoyable scenes that set the film apart from any other, even within Marvel's own history in film.",0
Can't forget Luis. Also I'm sure rocket would want to find his homies. ,2
Wow!!,1
Did you see that all star cast?,1
"It looks like cel-shaded 3D animation. So it's going to be CG, in three dimensions, but the characters will look like hand-drawn cartoons walked off the page.  Similar to RWBY and (oof) Star Wars Resistance, but with way more budget.",1
Gotg3 too,1
maybe even *the* good place,2
Probably because you got bad internet? Mine is crystal clear.,1
INSTA BONER,1
Can you guys digitally insert Don Cheadle performing as Rhodey into Iron Man 1 replacing Terrance Howard s scenes?  That way we have full actor continuity throughout all 22 films,2
His legacy will go on for many generations to come. ,1
I'm pretty sure that's just because Liz Hurley has a sexy voice.,1
Pom wtf is that ,1
You don t need smart things  he right.  but one day down the line smart enabled device are gonna actually be smart  Then things will bitchin! ,1
Really good.  I like the black Captain Marvel concept better than the current.  The curls really work too.,1
"nATaLie POrtMaN Won T PrOBaBly rEtuRN.  HAHAHAHA Doesn't matter if it sucks, you were WRONG",1
I think it's slated for 2021 (maybe 2022),1
The only one I actually care about.,1
Do we have a screen catch of Spidey doing that? The suit looked wonderful in that. ,1
Sean Gunn does motion capture for Rocket Raccoon.,1
"Nah. Nobody looks at this and says  oh, they support their director, probably hard to work with . It takes a lot more than that to get a reputation for being a hard ass in the industry, when your works say a lot more than your words.",3
I thought he looked like this in the future scenes where time has passed,1
Even Thor didn t know there were sorcerers on Earth until Dr. Strange summoned him. Apparently Kamar-Taj has been kept extremely well hidden.,3
True. Would have been a great time.,1
"I feel like that s asking a parent which child is their favorite. You might have a favorite kid, but you can t/shouldn t say it out loud .",1

 But it's not on Netflix here in NZ tho.,1
"Where did I say they re bad? I loved Joker, WW, Aquaman, Man of Steel and them...",1
Babe,3
My thoughts exactly. I cant bear to watch that movie again because the ending is so bad.,0

"If anyone could have done it as well as Gunn did, though, I think Taika Waititi could have. Ragnarok was like Fantasy GotG. ",1

"Ebony Maw looks creepy as fuck, the scene with Doctor Strange stole the trailer for me.",1
Awesome :),1
"Okay. Again, we have no reason whatsoever to believe that the villain has changed/will change. And if they did, they would tell us. You re just floating pointless hypotheticals.",1
They never didn t say that. I m hoping you re right,1
Isn't that literally just people who are ethnically jews but believe that Jesus is the messiah? That isn't antisemitic in the slightest lol,0
cant wait for this movie..its insane,1
Cap with shield actually looks like it could be Natasha with the shield. Which could happen in the event of a lot of crazy shit.,1
Let s not,1
"All tony did was snap thanos and his army away, not a percentage of the universe",1
Batista is fiercely loyal unless he sees a video of his two friends talking about how they ve been playing him for months. Or if you re Rey Mysterio and Dave really needs a heel turn to freshen up his character.,2
Did you freak out when you heard it in the movie?,1
Man I need the spoiler ban to lift so we can finally talk about it. I enjoyed it but still think Infinity War was better. It wasn t paced as well. The travel was messy and cheesy. I don t know man. I think it wrapped the series up well but it s a flawed movie.,1
"Yes,bring back the One Shot: in fact, let me pitch one I posted a few days ago.   https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/bnwl9n/so luis tries to file an insurance claim/",2

"I have no issue with people liking something, thats great! over 36 golds and 40 silvers for a movie trailer? And not even a independent one its part of a series (which doesn't make it bad, it just makes it all the more funny) ",2

"Damn, I thought this was fake when I saw this. Goodbye Mr. Lee",1
Cruel joke? How old did you want the poor bastard to live? Most people dont even like being 40 years old. ,0
"Hope you re still doing okay, OP.",1
The dark side is a pathway to many abilities some may consider to be unnatural,1
What if... tony and nebula are added into the walk in the trailer but missing in the movie? Wouldn't be out of character for the Russos to troll us like that,1
HOW IS HE NOT AGING,1
"I think Cap's shield part is when current Cap mind enters past Cap body.  That's his, 'oh shit, this plan is going to work' moment.  Then straps the shield tighter to put in some serious work.",1
I think it was confirmed that Sif got snapped and she was just off somewhere in space. Ghost Rider on the other hand should have been there. He either learned sorcery by himself or was in contact with other sorcerers,2
"Not officially but they've reached syndication and I'm pretty sure it may have been a fight to get season 5. I'd LOVE more seasons beyond 5, this show is the best, but I'm not getting my hopes up.",3
"I read your article, then replied. You seemed to think he needed the time stone to go back in time and a spaceship to go to space, even though what they were using was the quantum realm, moving through timespace. That allowed them to move through time and space at the same time. Otherwise Hawkeye and Black Widow would have needed a spaceship, too.",0
"Hey Kevin! I make props for a living (lightsabers, costumes, etc..), are you able to give me advice on how I could get into making props for movies?",1
"WTF Gal Gadot isn't  busty enough?  She's a supermodel. I did hear complaints that she wasn't muscular enough though, which I can understand.",1
Just wait until you get to season 4.,3
Thanos looks awful. Why can't Marvel produce a decent villain?,0
No Tom Hiddleston,1
"Well then the CG Artists did a good job, hurray! You'd be absolutely shocked to what extent movies like those in the MCU are composited.",2
Same. Then I saw it forming down below and my heart stopped for a couple seconds. ,2
"I mean yeah, but I like my forshadowing to be in universe haha",2
Hoping they move it over to the Disney streaming service.  The show is too good and the cast is too good for it to not continue. ,3
I really think that in 50 years the MCU will be looked at as a masterpiece of independent film. I just wish it was more popular today.,3
 RKO  TRAILER OUTTA NOWHERE,3
"Since they freely travel through space and time without the platform when Captain America and Iron Man take a detour to the 70s, it's clearly optional. Since Nebula is able to hack into their timestream using the platform, it's clearly some kind of space-time buoy to make getting back to the present easier.",1

"Yeah I reckon a Champions / Young Avengers vibe. Use the Loki series to introduce a Kid Loki reincarnation before it maybe? America Chavez is a must have too, she's just an amazing character. Her + Kamala + Shuri would be beyond awesome.",1

"I highly recommend everyone who hasn't check out some of his NZ-centric work from earlier in his career, especially Boy. An absolutely beautiful, funny, heart-wrenching film. I'm sure more of you have seen Hunt for the Wilderpeople or What We Do In The Shadows (which are both amazing in their own right) but Boy will always be his best work, to me. Definitely give it a look.",1

"Hello Mr. Feige, When was your  damn  moment where you realized you have such a positive impact and, did you read marvel comics as a child, in which did taking this job feel like such an emotional  time machine ?  Thank you so much!",1
"This is outdated, netwonian thinking. We need QUANTUM LOGIC for this puzzle. You can go back in time and kill baby Thanos, the problem is it doesn't mean anything for anyone but the people who are there to perceive it. Captain America is in his own alternate timeline, and it is the main timeline. Time and space are the results of quantum entanglements, and can exist in multiple paradoxical states at the same time.",2
James Gunn is nicely eloquent and very respectful to the directors he responds to.,1
I reckon they could get the actual Hell s Kitchen and just expand on it and maybe make the map more dark and clumped together with lots of like neon lights and things like that,1
That s the coolest thing ever! Congrats!,1
"well in thor 1, he says he comes from a place where science and magic are the same thing. just perspective probably",3
 His brother was an easy casting choice with chops like this. (url),2
">I've seen exactly one conviction so far, and one arrest, based on over 200 people accused so far There's more to someones perception of a person than whether they've been convicted in court. >Personally, I'm of the opinion that a false accuser should face the same sentence as the crime they lied about - but that's not relevant to my point above. Lemme know when one comes of this.",1
Spiderman is a hero. Betcha he'd never film vertically.,1
you can see it in his eyes that he most likely all members of his family.,3
Definitely. I just couldn't help but read what he wrote as Doc Brown.,2
"And she knows the guy quite well, unlike most of the avengers",1
In IF on Titan when they re going over the plan Mantis was just bouncing around in the back.,2
How is it to spend so much time making posts and comments trying to get people to be as angry as you and failing? Most feel good huh?,1
"But it's right there, Thor is in Wakanda. If he's not, I doubt that room is Thanos's porch anyway, it looks nothing like it ",2
I never even considered that but that s a great shout.,2
This one wins. ,1

ooh ooh! now do grabthar's hammer!,1
"I'm sure they'll write his character off, like they're doing with most of the OG Avengers, but I don't think he'll die. He'll most likely give Stormbreaker to Beta Ray Bill and become King of Asgard again and that's his happy ending.",2
But why that Cap helmet,1
When's Master Chief coming to the MCU?,1
"Yes people did go for an Eminem track, my partner is one of them, it became her favourite movie of the year aswell, all of those things add up, the Eminem fans, venom fans, marvel fans, Sony fans, Tom hardy fans and so on that is how you get bums in seats",0
"Well, Reddit isn't the only social media. Facebook and Istagram are their own bubble, not to mention WhatsApp and Snapchat where it's even less obvious because groups are more hidden from public. Lots of people, especially older ones, life in such bubbles. That said, you don't strike me as that kind of person, and your standpoint is anything but unreasonable, so I guess there is little more to discuss here.",1

BRING THE SHIELD STRETCHER!,3
"I ve said for years it needs to be set in the 50s or 60s to really really work.  There is just something magical about that era that  fits  so well with the FF. They could easily have half the movie about them getting off into space and then coming back through a wormhole or whatever into modern time and adjusting, it could be great.",1
Did you really just say hitherto undreamt of?,3
"Hello Kevin, how early was it determined to change Thanos motivation for the infinity stones from impressing Death to preserving resources?",1
"I think Most people agree that Steve was able to lift mjolnir in AOU, buy didn t because he didn t want to.",1
It shows just how much love the people at Marvel Studios have for the source material.  ,2
"Also, if she does battle with an alien force invading earth, how the fuck has nobody ever mentioned her throughout the whole franchise. Like she thwarts aliens and then when they attack again, nobody says  Where s that awesome blonde chick at . ",1

Patrick Doyle's Thor score is one of my personal favourites. That end credit theme is just magical.,3

Can Tony Stark Return as In virtual form as it is in comics?,1
Final battle against Galactus. But Galactus wins and eats Earth. Thats how the MCU ends for good.,1
"It's fairly early on in the game, maybe an hour or two and if I remember right.   When Peter and Mary Jane are meeting at a diner. (/spoiler)  It's a standard short cameo where he says one line and is on the screen for a couple of seconds.   ",3

Is there gonna be a Doctor Strange 2 or Venom 2???,1
That look Star-Lord gives Thor at the end of the trailer was the icing on the cake for me  ,1
Ealy and Urban were great. Heck...just about all the actors were awesome. The writing definitely started crumbling. I don t know if it was because they were running out of ideas or they knew it was getting cancelled. Would have loved to have seen more of Laroquette tho.,1

"I don't think I'd want them to use a Doombot fake out immediately, although I know how often that happens in the comics. I'd like to see BP win a pyrrhic victory over Doom, where Doom gets somewhat humbled but does some serious damage and manages to get away so he can build his strength/technology/magic over the course of the next phase, only appearing in occasional scenes (post credit and otherwise) and getting talked about in others.",2

"Disney has plans to introduce Deadpool to the MCU movies. Disregarding all the rumors saying so, when Disney acquired FOX they created a website welcoming all their new IPs. Ryan Reynolds Deadpool was present in that, he was part of the front page banner meaning he has a role in future Disney movies. None of the x-men were included which suggest they will recast everyone.",3
"Dude, go watch Agent Carter. It's only two seasons and there's really no closure, but it's definitely worth it.",3
"That's complete bullshit. It has absolutely nothing to do with Marvel. People have been saying cinema has been suffering from the success of **X** since cinema has been around. Each generation of filmmakers derides the new generation. It's just like everything else in life, the older you get, the brighter the past looks to you than the present.",2

"Disagree, in that, as I said, literally no other Marvel movie broke the moment (for me) like Ragnarok did. So it's definitely a problem with that movie, and that director. Maybe he didn't handle it as deftly, maybe the jokes just weren't funny, but it did not work for me. If the others didn't work for you, sure. But for me, it literally is an issue with Waititi.",1

"Amazingly enough, D D players run into this problem all the time. The established setting has all these super-powerful characters flying around saving the world all the time, so why aren't they saving the day this time rather than the PCs?  Because this story isn't *about* them -- if they show up, they're there as cameos. If not, they have their own problems to deal with, so go be friendly neighborhood PCs.",1

"This news absolutely melts my heart. Thank you Kevin Feige, Marvel and Sony for making this a dream come true. x200B You know, if everything goes well, they might extend their new deal for more MCU movies or make a new one with similar terms.

"It would be utterly dumb for Disney/Marvel to not greenlight these shows that used to be on Netflix for Hulu or Disney + (depending on how how kid friendly they want Disney + to be). It ll be kind of annoying since the Netflix produced seasons will stay on Netflix, but I d bet a lot of money that these shows aren t done for good. They will single handily gain a ton of subscribers on their own.",3
"His underlying point remains mostly the same. There isn t a single guitar signed by all the Beatles, which would make it crazy expensive.  A shield signed by actors- most of who are still around and signing shit- won t pull more than a couple grand. Far cry from retirement money.",1
So by the looks of it she has forgotten who she is and the movie will be her trying to remember that with the help of Samuel L Jackson,3

"True and Ditko deserves the credit for it, but where would Marvel be without Stan Lee and Jack Kirby? Those two are the reasons why those other marvel characters were able to get made.

I was wondering when the trailer came out with Paul Rudd being ant man and really questioned the casting choice.

"Dude, not even close to the same. First, Disney wasn't an anti-semite. Do the research. Second, they did make racist content in an era where everyone did. You can't just a pre-WW2, pre-Civil Rights movement cartoon through today's lens. It was a different time where Looney Toons, Tom and Jerry and all live action media was basically racist by today's standards. I love Gunn's work and don't even mind the jokes but your statement isn't comparing apples to apples.",0

"No... I'm not a dipshit....and no ...I didn't know what sub I was on . I've already posted that I thought I was on a different subreddit. Are you big, tough and cool for insulting me?",0
So this is how the trailer ends...with Thor-nderous applause,3
"Thankfully im not a public figure, have zero online presence, and dont plan on calling the cops on any kids selling water any time soon so im safe, but the concept is kind of scary. Brigades start and they fall into their own momentum and get out of hand fast. ",1
It s apocrypha.,2
"Serious question: how many white, over 40, big movie reviewers do you highly respect a review from?  Other than that she's just saying that she doesn't care what the  old money  thinks. I agree with her sentement 100    I'm a white guy. I'm happy to hear people going against the status quo",3
"There have been alot of hiccups. The difference between Marvel and DC is how they reacted.  Antman was a production nightmare, but they recovered. Thor 2 was underwhelming, instead of just repeating the same thing Marvel changed course with Thor 3. BvS was a shitshow so they gave suicide squad to a trailer company!?!  Now Justice league is a 400 million dollar  meh .",1
I mean it straight up says Official Trailer. And it was pretty damn underwhelming in my opinion. A teaser would be just a smaller hint at something. This was their idea of a good trailer for the movie.  Kinda hope they don't lose their mojo now.,1
That's a mighty big leap to make. People vote based on their personal beliefs. Those can range wildly between people.,2
"Exactly, but you don't even need a new actor, just have Jarvis control the suits and have Tony work on new tech at the lab that cameo's in other films.",1
"What about Vision?  I mean he is  Dead, Dead/really Dead  but wasn t  dusted .  It s odd to me to have Loki, Gamora and Vision all in the same category as the characters that were  dusted .   ",0
That... is exactly why he said raw strength?,1
Both movies were shooting at the same time.,1
Would've been better if Stan Lee signed it as well.,1
And when Tony said  who are you?  at the raft,1
"One of my friends did something very stupid.  I don't agree with what he did, but I'm helping him to work through the fall out from it.  I wouldn't do what he did, but I'm also trying to not push my beliefs on others.  I know what works for me so I'm just going to focus on that.",1
"Honestly? pretty underwhelming. Not putting Carol in this before her movie comes out seems like a misstep. Idk that is just my opinion.  Edit: I should have clarified, I think the trailer is pretty underwhelming and to a casual movie goer this would be boring, outside of that, I think not putting Carol in the first trailer is a misstep.

That Corvus Glaive spearing Visions face 1:42? Can't figure out who the third person is,1
Loki from the first avengers/thor film was the only memorable villain. The rest have been utterly forgettable. ,0
> let the man retire That's the problem for his ending. Tony Stark can't just  retire  from the Avengers.,3
"The world that they made for Black Panther is a ton better than the actual movie. The third act really fell apart, but I'm hyped for the sequel. There's just so much potential with Wakanda and obviously the design is awesome. If Namor is the villain in 2 it'll be awesome.",1
"Nothing, but people want it anyway. When the sub fills up with posts like  let s just take a minute to thank/appreciate X  when X is one of the most popular things among fans of the subreddit, it becomes unbearable. It becomes harder to find the OC or posts with actual insight.",3
"Yea they definitely have some great space stories, but I kinda meant it's not like their powers would be OP for that storyline. Like introducing Thor/Captain Marvel in a gang warfare movie would not make sense bc he would stomp them in seconds",2
"That's a good point. I was looking at a list of highest grossing franchises, which those didn't show up on for obvious reasons. They are also both before social media, so we didn't see too much cross-film support.",1

I think we're going to be seeing a **lot** of Tom Holland soon.",1

Please don't take this comment about race because I'm not talking about race I'm talking about looks. Valerie Jarret does kinda look like one of those characters on planet of the apes and race has nothing to do with it.

I though the comment was racist too at first until I seen a picture of Valerie Jarret.  ,0
"That's kind of where I am too. My most wanted Marvel movie would be a Hulk reboot disconnected from the MCU at large, just because, well, I think the MCU is kind of over to me, and Hulk's the guy I think was least well served in terms of  what I want out of Hulk as a character  in the movies.",1

"Well also, the fact that Thanos was able to round up all the Stones in a day never sat well with me, so I kind of imagined he'd learned about the Stones and began pursuing them fairly recently--probably within the past couple years.

"They actually weren't all snapped.  Vision, Gamora, and weirdly Rocket were all in there.",1
I honesty don t think Hulk can be interesting on his own. He isn t going to be threatened by anything and his powers basically make him invincible unless he s fighting something from another world. ,3
Roseanne got her show back on the contingency that she would stop tweeting crazy shit. She d already had a second chance and she squandered it,2
*bord,1
It's for wiping buttocks ,1
Make that cheddar boyyyyy!,0
Way better than Brie Larson :),0
"> Monica Rambeau Wait, where? Also: >LETS GOOO! Hell yes!",2
The first one is very Magneto-esq,1
"The MCU might just say Peter when to hiding due to his identity being revealed, they might even let Mary Jane or some other characters be spider man",1
"I forgot about that. I guess you're right. I can't speak for them, of course, I can only show you what I've seen online. I guess Aunt May was changed in their plan then. But I'd be happy to assume that they spoke the truth about everyone else unless we see alternate information in the future.",1
This isn't even my fiNAL FOOOOOORM,1
They re both in avengers four doe,1
She looks so majestic. Hope that we ll see more of her in the future.,1
"Hi Kevin! Thanks for doing this. I just wanted to thank you for all you ve done for the Marvel universe. My question is, what s your personal favorite MCU movie and what s your favorite MCU moment? Have a great day! Oh and one more thing, can I get an autograph?  ",1
"Begone trolls, representation =/= sexism ",3
TONY STARK BUILT IT IN A SPACESHIP. WITH NEBULA. AND A BOX OF SCRAPS,1
The best part is the little smile she gives him after she says it.,3
> he s taking the armour off as he gains more stones but him with armor looks cooler and is more iconic,2
My brand!!!,2
My guess is that is a hulk sized hole. Maybe Stark too?,1
"Nah, he's with Blake Lively now.",3
I appreciated him staying fat for the movie. it showed that he could wield his power in any form and his form wasn't dependent on Mjolnir or Stormbreaker.,3
It was just a matter of time. There was no chance Marvel would just cut Spidey and continue on. Spidey is the new Tony Stark. Nobody should ve actually worried.,1
MULTIVERSE TRAVEL!,3
Yeah wtf.  Screenshot from the movie. ,2
I d go further and say this is true regardless who you are. It s not unheard of for employers or other agencies you may interact with to check social media habits before or during employment.,1
Nope. I don't understand the hype around it and I consider myself a Marvel fan. ,0
"> the decision to make Captain America: The First Avenger a period World War 2 film. It actually surprises me that you got pushback on that, and I'm so glad you fought for it. Cap's story *has* to start in WW2 if you want to tell it right, IMO.",3
"Yeah... Guys, I got it. Woo-hoo!",1
white thanos white thanos,1
This is the good timeline then,2
SSHHHHHHH don't leak the script!,1
"It would be kind of funny if he was really disappointed by the movie, like Last Jedi fanboy disappointed.",0
"My guess is that he ll survive Guardians 3 and Thor 4, and maybe Avengers 5 will be his last hurrah.",1
"What has been your favorite part and/or character of the MCU to date, and why?",2
"This trailer shows fuck all. Just the surviving characters sitting, licking their emotional wounds. I love it.",1
Who knows. The Russo's said Loki was definitively dead after IW and yet now he managed to escape  in an alternate past.  No telling what happens going forward.,1
It's great because Mysterio is such a try hard that the more over the top and obnoxious they make the suit the more in character it is.,3
You re gorgeous OP and that costume is amazing!,1
90 minutes of post-credit scenes? I didn't know Hideo Kojima worked on this movie. ,3
UNLIMITED,3
"In 616, Cap sometimes does the art for the Captain America comic",3
">It'll be a travesty if they don't, same with Fisk and Punisher It will be more of a travesty if they do. You really want a punisher where he goes after torrent users  and knocks all the bad guys unconscious with coconut traps?",1
Can he even keep any of his suits? They're technically Stark tech.,2
I fucking dreaded the day this would happen.   Rest In Paradise to a LEGEND!!!,1
"You re totally right. Captain Marvel and to a lesser extent Black Panther and Guardians Vol. 2 all proved that the movies don t have to release in a linear, chronological order.",3
This makes me incredibly happy!!!!! I hope/assume this means Korg is returning too!!!!!,1
Haven't watched a  super hero  movie since the green goblin spider man :),0
"5 movies: homecoming, far from home, civil war, infinity war and endgame and more than that, he is set up as the next iron man, not just a guy you can cast aside (sort of)",3
"Avengers, ASSEMBLE!",3
"Na, old cars are bare bones mechanical pieces of art. You can fix anything with a wrench. My car now doesn't even have a dipstick, a computer has to tell me my oil level, and I have to trust the sensors aren't fucked",1
Let's GOOOO!,1
Soul stone and no guardians/no Thanos is the same AR tho.,1
"He didn't really try to kill Thor, he was just hurting him",1
In half a day.,1
"The last report I read said  the door is closed for now (https://variety.com/2019/film/news/spiderman-mcu-sony-pictures-chief-1203324907/), according to Sony.  Who knows what's happening behind the scenes, though.",3
Hopefully we'll get at least some plot details released for She Hulk now.,3
Eat poop disney.,1
He s got a line in Both movies i think,3
Who s your favorite casting choice you ve done in the MCU?,1
"Are you saying you just rewatched ATLA and understood the reference to the finale but you don't understand the reference to the title montage? Get outta here, you filth.",3
Guy goes from a thief to being the catalyst that enables the Avengers to bring back half the population of the universe.,3
r/INEEDIT,1
Oh tru,1
"Yeah I definitely feel you, sometimes using songs other than the score almost cheapens the experience. For a more serious film like Endgame, it might be better to avoid real songs. ",2
goes without saying but this is better than the official promos,1
"If you had the opportunity to include one DC character to the MCU, which one would you choose?",1
"Same. Obviously, lol.",1
So you like Thor Dark World more than GOTG 2?,1
And it'll make Thanos' hole weak.,3
The way the Venom movie was done I don't feel like it would be much of an incursion honestly and it would be good to see what Fiege could do with Venom. I welcome them in other words.,2
That s not what I remember. I remember people just being like  wtf that s weird but dope as fuck  and we were all expecting it to be revealed as a joke logo from Taika.,1
"As long as the foundations stay intact, they should be good.",1
I feel giving the character growth or bonding between Ironman and Nebula there should of been atleast something between them maybe even just a look or something,1
"Hi, Kevin! Thank you so much for all your hard work! One question: is Natasha's soul what made the soul stone so bright?",1
Probably. But the mcu hasn't given us much information in their version of thanos. For all we know he may not be a deviant.,2
Hi Mr. Feige. How long till we can see F4 or Dr.Doom in the MCU ? Are you planing something about them now or not ? Keep doing what you are doing cause you are killing it and Thank You 3000.,1

thfour?,1
"And just like westerns and gangster movies, superhero movies will be less popular in the future. I wonder what genre of movies will popular though.",1
CAT THOR,1
Wanda destroyed one stone with one hand while holding Thanos with the other one. I would say she's the most powerful but marvel don't want to show her power as captain marvel is supposed to be the strongest one now.,3
That was... Fast,3
Yes. That the Thanos theory is silly AF and never had grounds in reality. ,2
Probably just the flashback ? Or someone managed to destroy his armors,3
"Did he though? Wasn't it actually Dr. Cho that did that, Ultron only provided the vibranium and the Mind Stone.",1
"It's taken a long time, but we are in the Endgame now boys !!!!",1
We need you grandma.,3
Gunn has already said that Vol 3 would be the end of that team. It's certainly possible that the franchise continues under a different version. I personally like the idea of a mostly female or all female GotG team.,1
Thor pretty good.,1
"Hey bud, what's the definition of epic?",1
"Black, gold, and red is one of my favorite color combinations. Looks awesome.",1
He s uninteresting because he s op. The same thing will happen to Captain Marvel.,0
Gorr could also lead to Knull which would lead to the Symbiotes.,2
I didn t wanna link my own comment but tbh this was my exact thought  ,1
" If I am ever lucky enough to get there, then I should act as he does. -Sauce (http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/spidey-stars-open-with-emotions)",3
Yeah bigotry doesn't really have a logical inciting incident. Assholes will be assholes and hate on people who aren't like them.,2
It s one part product and one part repetition.  You have to keep doing your hair a particular way get it to lay the way you want it to. Without product his hair won t look anything like that.  Source: hair sorta similar to that.,2
"Nit - they were Hydra sleeper cells, not Nazis. Otherwise your point is excellent.",1
" Why do we fall master Wayne? So we can learn to pick ourselves up . - Alfred. Different comic universe, but still a great message and similar to what you said about Thor in Endgame",1
"Iron Man, Cap 1, Avengers, Guardians 1, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, Infinity War, and Ant-Man   Wasp",1
Who is in the top right corner? I dont recognize her,1
 get this man a shield  obviously an upgrade. ,1
marvel? more like marvel-ous!  Am I right guys?! ,1
Omg you're right,1
"That would be an issue, but it's a bit like knowing that Uma Thurman survives Kill Bill part 1. Its more about seeing the development of Clint into Ronin.",1
What if material,1
Is this the head of the DCU asking for advise?,1
"Look if someone accused James Gunn of doing something bad to them, there would be little support for him. Difference between the two of them is night and day, jokes are just jokes.",3
MCU Sucks! Stop destroying the damn comics,0
 ...and then she was like OH HULK I'M SO HOT FOR YOUR BUT WE'RE BOTH SO DAMAGED and then Hulk got sent into space and Thor had to rescue him from some old guy... ,1
"There's a powerful scene in one of the big comic book crossovers a few years back where it appears like all hope is lost (bad guy won, most everyone dead or missing) and someone asks Cap what the plan should be, and Cap just hangs his head down and starts sobbing.  It was pretty crazy seeing that on the comic book page because Captain America is supposed to be the leader who always holds it together, publicly at least.  I wonder if that's the inspiration for this scene.",3
"Now I'm curious, which Thor story will they take inspiration from? Like, where else do they go with the character?",1
This is amazing!  He s built like a LAD on the r/virginvschad sub,1
Tom Hanks?! An no shot he s gone- him and Benedict (also Rudd and Pratt) are the new faces of the franchise,1
It would be funny if he does and it still sucks.,3
*Thor: Asgardians of the Galaxy*,1
"The guy who got hot, cheated on and then left his wife for greener pastures?",1
I really wish they had kept eye patch thor longer,2
"I don t know. Maybe there s some concept that most people are nice for personal gain, keeping images, doing favors so that you can get some pay back. But a guy like RDJ doesn t really need any of that personal gain, he s already RDJ, he made it. So these gestures seem to have less to do with external motivation and more to do with being genuine.  ",1
"I know! Every time I go back to re-watch Doctor Strange, that's what I like to think goes there in the empty spot in the library. I believe that someone who worked on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has said a few times that it was an intentional tie-in, but don't quote me on that. I'd have to do a lot of digging to try and find where he said that.",2
I m guessing that since they bring Vision to Wakanda that the army is after the mind stone. I m guessing we won t see the Soul Stone until the next movie. ,1
Am the only one that doesnt really want another Spiderverse movie? It was so good as a stand alone and didn't really imply a sequel at all. I guess I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to Miles story but I really don't want to see the multiverse involved again.,0
"Yeah but that's still a victory and half the universe doesn't get destroyed. Earth gets fucked up sure which does suck.  But remember also that Thanos suffered a huge amount of loss. Between decimating Xander, the Asgardians and invading Earth, his army got destroyed and most of his children killed. He has the 5 stones which makes him a one man army but he's also working with less resources now. And what's to say after losing everything and still not accomplishing his goal that he wouldn't just give up",1
Is anyone else bothered by Blackwidow's hair not being red?,1
Bruh this shit this could tie so heavily with AoS if you're right!! ,1
I don't understand praising someone for wasting so much time lol I'm not impressed and think the editing looks like shit,1
'stensions!,0
"I'm honestly tired of these  legendary  directors shitting on something simply because it's mainstream. You don't have to make pretentious, artsy films to tell a good story with better themes.",1
It looks like you're implying that a conservative only sees things in black and white,1
But his sunglasses look distinctly more CGI.,1
"Give that man a shield. ... And that man some hot cocoa and an arm. ... You know, while we're at it, upgrades for everyone!",1
"Yes, I think AOU did pretty bad compared to the first film. I think Endgame was also a decent film.",1

"Has this movie come out yet? If it hasn't, isn't this just... an ad? Edit: I don't want this to be a question we're not allowed to ask",2
"No. They had these movies planned over 5 years ago. It was not a late insert, it was planned years in advance. They went into writing both Infinity War and Endgame knowing full well she was joining the roster. It's going to be no different than Scarlett Witch, Quicksilver and Vision joining in Age Of Ultron except we'll already know the character (which is a positive). ",1

"OH duh, I just got back from a trip to Arizona so U of A is stuck in my head.  If they have parts set before IW, I hope they're just flash backs during their future adventures.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm not interested in watching a Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen love story while they try to lay low after the events of CW. I'm guessing they didn't use their powers much or do anything because they were trying to keep a low profile.  ",1

"Her character has been strangely neglected. In the comics she has the Russian version of Cap's super soldier serum. In the movies she's just.... a really good spy/assassin. How do you sell her in her own super hero movie when she isn't technically super and when there are already a thousand spy movies out there? I was hoping that was the direction her character was taking in the next phase, leading to her own series of movies, but..... yeah.",3

They will take your crazy and believe it.",1
Please have John Krasinski   Emily Blunt play Reed Richards   Sue Storm!!,1
It s insane how well done they are.  The Death and Reign of Superman were probably my favorite animated movies of that year.,3
Did they ever address how Cull Obsidian had it in Infinity War?,0

Ha nice,1
"Thanks for doing this Kevin. Can you clear up who has the rights to characters like Namor and She Hulk? The rumor is Universal owns at least distribution rights, but does that mean we cant see characters like Namor, the Leader, She Hulk or others pop up in established MCU movies like Black Panther 2 or Dr. Strange 2?",1
I'm a conservative and Roy Moore can go fuck himself. You speak in absolutes - this is doing your argument a disservice. Plus you seem very angry.,0
"Hi Kevin, It really felt like some of the real important parts of Hulk/Banner's development happened offscreen. Can you talk about the decision to leave out the  how  Hulk/Banner came to coexist? Or how it seems like the Hulk persona was suppressed?",1
I want to believe. But Captain Marvel had 90s Coulson and not a May in sight.,1
I'd like to see Bill Skarsgard as Nightcrawler even though he was Zeitgeist already. Maybe allow Stellan to cameo as Selvig for a scene with him.,3
Thor can definitely bench press more than captain marvel.,1
They only had about 10 minutes of footage available to cut the trailer IIRC,3

"The  HDR  in r/shittyHDR is a digital camera effect which captures an image at multiple exposures and then composites it together.

Totally agree on that,1
"Nope. Despite what fringe, sweaty YouTubers will tell you, she said nothing close to that",1

I wish they would've added something along the lines of  and as such we've collectively chosen not to participate in GotGV3 without Gunn. It's been a great experience working with Marvel up to this point. ,2
"I agree, AoU has some flaws and it s really messy in some aspects. But their is some really interesting stuff in it that keeps me entertained even after i rewatched the movie several times. And i just love Ultron as a villian, even if he s very different from the comics and some of his jokes were flat. It would be really interesting to see Whedon s version of IW and EG and how he would ve handled all the characters and storylines.",1
Get Vengeance for Gammora's death,1
"Okay maybe I was a little harsh calling him complete shit. I m projecting Because of the subsequent over rating. You touched on what is really my issue.

Lol the whole thing was political from the start. I'm just sharing that many months before  Hollywood normalize(d) being a pedophile  our president came out to support someone who had multiple real people coming out and accusing him of assault. ,2
Accurate honestly ,3
They showed Ronan but we've already been introduced to him as a villian so no real need to show em off ,0
No. Black Panther and Captain Marvel wouldn t exist if that were the case,3
Don't assume an idea is  mostly unanimous  just because it comes up often and you agree with it.,2

I know right! All the hate yet they re still going to go watch it. ,1
"Hey! I know this may be a stretch, but what are your thoughts on the Marvel Netflix series and the MCU. I know that due to reasons there probably can t be a proper crossover, but would there ever be a possibility of a nod to the characters in the films?  Not sure if you ll see this but keep up the great work!",1

Is it just me or does the green screen feel off in this?,0
"Nobody's upset that these guys don't like the Marvel films  not everyone does. But it's the parting jabs at the end of each of their statements-- it's not cinema  from Scorsese    it's despicable  from Coppola--it's those unnecessary, petty, dismissive, objectively false (in Scorsese's case), overly cruel (in Coppola's case) insults that have us bothered.",2

"While the quality of story and writer is important, every universe goes through power cycles. Luther mutates, cybernetically enhances, creates an army of super beings during the rebirth of Superman series, and does many other things that power creep is evident in.

There s a clear bias in the way you phrase it and also a clear contempt for the people who disagree with you. Thank you everyone for proving my point.

So it's fine to be racist back then because everyone else was doing it? You realize how stupid that sounds. All Gunn did was tell some unfunny jokes to try to be edgy.  I'm not saying we should hold Disney accountable either. Why? Because it's in the past. Same thing with James Gunn. That was the point I brought up that you missed apparently. That the past shouldn't matter as much as the present. ,1

They flip things in post all the time. Maybe they decide they wanted Thanos to be walking from right to left on the screen instead of left to right. Just a small change like that. And you have to flip the image. Luckily he is CGI or the gauntlet would be on the wrong hand.,1
"Old message could even just mean like a couple months or even a week. If Scott doesn't get out of the quantum realm immediately, then it'll stand to reason everyone would assume he got dusted. ",1
It's great. But Thor's iconic entrance is the battle on the Rainbow Bridge in *Ragnarok*. And then for bonus points along comes Tessa Thompson sashaying along and swishing her sword.... ...with mood music from Led Zeppelin. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihjx3mX75y8),1

Lang will deliver the nuke and then go subatomic (or whatever, been awhile since I saw Ant-Man) to avoid getting disintegrated.

"So if Feige were to say yes or no to a question that has no bearing whatsoever on the individual characters on AoS and their development and plots (because AoS is and has always been irrelevant to the MCU films), it would affect your enjoyment of AoS?  The point is, they are so separate, especially now, that him saying they're canon or not doesn't even matter. So why put any stock into it, especially when you knew he wasn't even going to bother to answer since it's irrelevant.",1

Same here. I hope Budapest remains an elusive reference for MCU that will keep people wondering. And make people keep wondering by having Hawkeye occasionally mention Budapest in passing in future movies.,1
"Who said it was acceptable for the guys? I enjoyed Thor 1 and 2 at face value but there's a reason Ragnarok felt like a rebirth of the series for many, because he too was flat and dull in the first two movies, and they get the flack they deserve. Ragnarok brought so much more charisma and personality and was an astounding success because of it. Please don't turn this into a gender thing",2
"As part of that, Spidey had great movies. They even cast Keaton as Vulture which worked so well he's still my favourite villain in MCU. Growing up watching Vulture in the animated series I'd never have given him that level of respect. Keaton owned it.",2
"I don't care what people say, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is a great movie! I would even say that I like it better than Avengers(2012), don't get me wrong, Avengers(2012) is one MCU classics but there is something about AoU that gravitates me.",3
I mean 2022 will have 4 movies and 3 tv shows most likely already as it is.  2023 will probably get more shows with it as well so it s just as packed as each other. Pushing something back won t help anything,2

Also, getting the recovered drug addict, partier to play an alcoholic partier isn't a super stretch either.  Definitely a gamble, but it clearly made sense.

"For believing that Sony and Disney should have come to a compromise instead of refusing to work together? It's pretty standard business practice that one party lowballs the offer while the other highballs it, then they alter the deal until they reach a middle ground where both parties are happy.

"Just watched Endgame last night (for the umpteenth time) and I believe Howard's statement here was the moment Tony decided that if it came down to it, he'd sacrifice everything to save the universe.

These people create  products  which care for both. You can download 10gb and 1-2 gb rips of the same movie. There is a quality difference between them but it's mostly noticeable on better screens and mostly if you know what to look for. And 2 gb is a very good size for streaming. Youtube uses about 2gb of memory for one HOUR of video at 1080p 30fps. You should expect better from a dedicated streaming service which streams movies not vlogs AND it's a paid service.,1

" In this one shot we see a familiar face. His name is Samuel L Jackson. He's been in loads of the other MCU movies as Nick Fury, and it's really cool to see him in this one.

Good for her. I still don t know a single person who wants this movie other than her though.,0
Kevin! Thank you for being the balancing force behind this insane cinematic universe!  What you and your team have done with the MCU has no-doubt completely changed the landscape of film   tv moving forward. What's your response to more studios and companies trying to create their own cinematic universes?  Any advice you'd give to those hoping to capture part of what the MCU has done?,1
Yeah I mean having millionaire parents probably helped more then any of that.,0
Thank YOU so much! Get well soon enough!,3

Talk to me when that car hits 500k. Also when you have to repair it and then need to spend a few hundred dollars at the dealership for them to tell the computer it's ok to run now.

 Hell yeah! (url),1
"I think in the context of just seeing this scene, it s a bit cheesy, but if this were in the cut of the film I saw in theatres, this would have broken my heart.

I figured its some sort of suit that makes it easier for the suits to fly down and connect to him. They can't each be flying around with an arc reactor in them already,1

"I know. But like I said, if Thanos had taken the fight seriously, the space team wouldn't have stood a chance. If all the Avengers fought against 2018 Thanos, he definitely wouldn't have taken the fight easily. So Thanos would've still won.",1
"if ike won ,feige would no longer be in the mcu and tony would get a much small part in civil war",1
That's why he goes by Happy...makes sense  ),1
"I like that Cap looked so exhausted, he kinda staggers slightly then slumps down on one knee. That man needs a rest too.",3
"I m not going to believe anything about Alita being good considering people were using it as a tool (and nothing else) to bring down CM. Brie was getting hate waaay before the movie. Lmfao. Brie is a great actress, but she can t be relatable or interesting if the material isn t there. Funny that they cut her feminist backstory to appeal to dudebros and then dudebros still think it s too feminist.",2
If they don t bring back the Netflix cast into the movies we riot,1
"Hi Kevin, In Endgame, when Steve and Tony traveled to the 1970s, why was Peggy still young in that time period? Shouldn't she have been in her 50s? I would not be surprised if it was deliberate but was curious about the reasoning.",1

"Can you confirm any unknown information on phase 4  that doesn't compromise any details set to be revealed at any convention such as comic con, thanks I understand if this can't be answered.",1
That's...normal.,0
People who say this are so full of shit lol.,3
Rocket would be specifically looking for that ship. It's going to be him. He doesn't know the other Guardians all didn't make it. It's absurd how many people are saying CM will just blindly bump in to some ship around Titan instead of hauling ass to Earth.,3
"Well, if time travel is actually happening, then it wouldn't be. They might kill Tony off in the beginning. Pepper gets the message from Nebula, and becomes Rescue (so she could rescue Tony). They go back in time to fix everything. However, Stark ends up dying against Thanos this time. Who knows?",3
"Oh, I agree. The lack of consistency irritates me. But I think it is healthy to remind ourselves that it's fairly clear the filmmakers were going for  make good movie first  and  make internally consistent power levels among avengers  a distant 976th.",1

Either that or it's an  Edge Of Tomorrow /  Groundhog Day  scenario where they have to keep going back in time to try and defeat Thanos over and over again... Whatever it takes.,1
> more flops than hits these past 7-8 years That's not entirely on her. You could define pretty much the entire movie industry outside of the MCU like that at the moment.,1
It's because its never mentioned but Cap has a shield with magnets and stuff in AOU but then never uses that shield again so its assumed he decided not to use it again,3
"Excelsior, Stan. Thanks, for everything.  Ugh, this one hurts.",1
What did Wanda do?,1
Honestly If that happened to me I would probably crash.,1
"You do realize it s one of, if not the, most popular movie ever, right? It s not a kids movie. Comic books have always been read by adults as well and the content of the movies is far more adult than geared towards children. It s not cringe to enjoy something that hundreds of millions of people around the entire planet enjoy. You seem like a sad dude who doesn t enjoy much so you have to shit in things that are extremely popular to make yourself feel better.",1
It wouldn t be right though. Marvel Televison and Loeb were the ones who had a role in the season. I doubt Feige would want to attach the Studios logo to anything he didn t have his hands in anyway.,1
"I actually though of this a few days back, so funny to hear.",1
"But what if Matt turns off all the lights? Checkmate, atheists.",3
"Oddly enough, this was what made me cry.  The relief on Cap's face was so well played that it felt real.  I am not sure any other actors could have made these movies what they are. They literally would have been nothing without RDJ.",2
"That's the way to flush 100 million down the toilet, Marvel!!!  Your P.C., strong-female lead push is going to break you some day. I can already tell this will be a shit movie.",0

"But I read that article and all the Facebook posts and the only thing I see is that he didn t want to talk to them. I doesn t seem like being an asshole to me, I guess. I get it. He has reporters and fans following him all the time I m sure. It s gotta be tiring. If he was outwardly rude to people, or made things more difficult, sure, but the only thing I got from that article is that he wanted to be alone. ",1
No. It's bad enough that shit is in almost every tv show. So few today seem to know how to address modern issues without hamfisting it and making it fully black and white. I enjoy movies and shows that can handle that stuff in a nuanced way but the stuff done today is so tied to this specific year that it's gonna look highly dated in a couple years.,1
"This is the truth. Feige s so good that they split off Marvel Studios from Marvel Entertainment just because they wanted to give him complete creative control, and it was probably one of the best Marvel-related decisions Disney has made.",3
"The First Avenger felt kind of boring to me when I first watched it, and in the second half especially it felt less like a film and more like a trailer for the Avengers. While I think it s still the weakest of Cap s solo films, a lot of the scenes in it feel much more complete and emotional when you know what they lead to.",2
Coke or Pepsi?,2
"I want a satirical, dark comedy series about Howard's adventures in space and on earth.",3
"I think I agree with all of her decisions except for Brie Larson and Captain Marvel. She is about the most uncharismatic person in all of the movies. I'd say she was even  miscast.  Impressive to go 22 movies with only 1 person, to me, feeling like that, however.",1
Yeah kinda sucks,1
"Considering they re 100  responsible for the success of these new spiderman movies, yeah, I d say it s reasonable",0

"It's a flippant comment, calm down mate. ",1
I doubt ever see a live action movie happening but I wouldn t rule out an animated feature,1
/r/UnexpectedCBB,2
"I just read a story line in Hickman's Avengers World where the next Avengers come back in time, and they are all kids of previous Avengers/heroes, and Cap/Widow had a son.",1
"Heh, I haven't seen a single Wes Anderson movie. No intention to either. They look visually stunning, but otherwise insufferable. And I'd consider myself a pretty pretentious person, too! They should be right up my alley. I understand that r/marvelstudios is full of Marvel fans, with most of us being familiar with Captain Marvel, but I know next to nothing about her and still understood what was going on in the trailer. It ain't that hard to pay attention for two minutes.",0
"I thought the deal was that Sony owns characters that made their first appearance in Spider-Man comics which, IIRC, does not include Spider-Girl.",1
"If you want to see wonky CGI, check out Superman in Justice League  ) still time to color correct and make the live plate and CGI suit more seamless. ",1
"Oh man, that shield ",1
"Wow, some good DAoC Memories right here...",1
">Well, I don t think seeing every film makes one s opinion irrelevant.  If the opinion is a sweeping generalization of a whole category of films, an opinion is irrelevant if you haven't seen at least the majority of movies in that category.",3
I'd like for this to have been included. Maybe it sends a subtle message that taking a knee is respectful and that the NFL anthem protests are respectful.,1
And she proudly shows off her kids' anime fanart and took math classes so she could help them with their homework.  3,3
The battle on Titan was far better. They fought as a team and with cohesion. The only other time I remember the Avengers fighting like that was in Age of Ultron. They knew each others  abilities and used that knowledge to better their attack. The HQ battle was mostly them going at Thanos  army alone or maybe going 2/3 to one.,1
Hmm to think Andrew Garfield + Emma stone lost to Tobey Mcguire hehe.,1
It was a revolutionary movie. New techniques + technology + stunning visuals never really seen before in a movie.,1
"Kombat Pack 2 is still up in the air, let s see Thanos, Ash Williams, maybe Akuma from street fighter if Capcom grows a pair of balls",1
I legitimately believe that a lot of Disney suits told Gunn he couldn t make Rocket a believable character (due to him being a Raccoon) and that s why Rocket ended up being such an emotional character instead of comic relief. Just a fuck you to the people who told Gunn he couldn t do it. ,2
Did he wreck those things in the original cut cus I don't remember that,1
"McKay apparently was actually approached for it, even if some of the others werent. ",1
Yea but there wasn't any downtime here. When would he have made more?,3
One of my favorite scenes In endgame is when (Endgame spoilers) >!When Wanda said he killed her family and he is like I don t even know you.! ,1
Hey Mr. Feige! I just wanted to know if there was ever any other cinematic universe you ever wanted to pursue whether in the past or present?,0
"and in the movies quite a bit. Most recent was when peter gave her the gauntlet, some people like to ignore them to boost their argument though",3
Waititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi,1
Whoops. Meant 3rd person to like them for the above redditor. There is only one movie. I would've liked to have seen a Warrior Within movie.,1
did i just cry. that editing is worthy of an mcu movie,1
"He would have brought everyone back,  plus the sudden appearance of many kegs of beer.",1
WAKANDIANS IN AN OPEN FIELD NED!!!,1
It s got electrolytes!,3
Perfect Marketing.,1
"This is absurdly well done! I'll take it in IV form, please.",1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewFg5wUvkGI,1
"So you ve said. The discussion was about Marvels casting choices. You elected to list leading actors. I then added Scarlet Johansson because of the choice they made to cast her. You may have started the conversation but you don t own the discussion. I m comfortable with the reasons that I ve stated for bringing her up, it s really that simple and I don t think I need to repeat myself. It s such a small thing anyway that I think we can move on now.",1
Looks amazing!!!,1
"Ha, google thought the same thing recently! Until they investigated and found *men* were being underpaid.  Mmmmmhhhmmm interesting.  I ll post this to save you the trouble:  https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=700288695",0
"it wasn't great but i enjoyed it, and endgame and far from home alone make it the best year",1
Can we have a short pee break intermission tho ,2
Maybe exerting anger for what happened? ,2
Do you just rip a juul for the smoke effect or is it a miniature fog machine?,1
Quantum Weed YEAHHH,1
" Tried   think  lol, you know you nailed it.",3
"Maybe I'm crazy, but this might confirm the theory that he was fired because they didn't want the bad PR when the merger was announced, and now that the merger is going to close next week, they can bring him back. ",1
What is your opinion on Thanos being slain by Ant-Man via expanding within his backside?,2
The full title is  Captain America: Civil War ,1
"Pretty sure that Renner, Scarlet, Hemaworth, RDJ, and Evans are all technically up with this movie.  They can kill anyone any time (as the contract is just options and not a guarantee of appearance) but those guys have fulfilled their obligation. ",3
"It's why I never even started reading the current run. I was hyped for it. I didn't think the characters had been used well beforehand (coughAvengersArena Undercover), so I was all in for a return to form. Then I started reading interviews with the writer and it became quite obvious that what she wanted to write was basically fanfiction. Shipping two popular characters together despite them showing little interest in each other in the past is just par for the course.",1
"Burt Macklin, legendary outlaw",3
"Definitely. Also I'm looking forward to what they do with Hot Aunt May. If they avoid the trope of  mother-figure is dating Big Bad,  it could be nice to have a superhero that real-life kids with single parents can empathize with as they see their mom dating decent people. It's a huge amount of conflict in teenage life that Marvel really hasn't tackled the nuances of. Hell, most movies don't take on those kind of nuances.",1
Lol the joker and Harley were my favorite parts. I liked the real world but yet over the top crazy they were. Not the gamers rise up bullshit. Just an interesting fresh take. Oh well taste is subjective. ,1
"I really hope he does that Mephisto-part to subtly help the Avengers before he dies. He then gets a legitimate statue on wherever the new Asgard will be. I'm so sick of Loki's bad-good-bad cycle. I hope he dies as a hero, I think that's the best way to end his character. ",1
"It was a huge missed opportunity sadly, That endgame scene could have had so much more meaning to us millions of fans.",2
"That's just, like, your opinion, man. (Literally)",3
Marvel should hire you to create MCU Grand Design.,3
The poses are different though,1
*snorts* It's *Herbie* Hancock.,1
And the talking tree that can t talk got everyone to cry when he sacrificed himself to save the rest of the guardians. Now that is heart!,1
Ronin looks dope and I don't even care for him that much.,3
I read Chris Evans like Matt Damon was said in Team America World Police,1
"Remember, remember the 16th of December",1
"I mean 5 of the highest grossing films of all time, I don t see how that s not part of film history",2
She s got a new movie coming out though,3
"the screenshots are not representative of how it actually looks on a good 4k tv, that's what I'm trying to tell you. There is no artifacting as obvious as it is in this picture. First, we don't even know where/how OP got the pictures. Second, the picture gets compressed once uploaded to the internet anyways, so it's impossible to know what part of the image is poor due to the stream or due to how the image itself was edited and uploaded.",1
u/Anthony-russo u/joe-russo  Good luck!,1
Oh I was under the impression that Venom was in a universe separate from the ASM films.,2
"Way I see it ain't nothing wrong with a girl showing off an excellent ass she's clearly put a ton of work into, so long as she has primary decision making power over ass-to-face screen time ratio.",0
Hey Kevin. What licensed music were you most happy to see in an MCU movie?,1
" Boom, you lookin for this ",1
I mean the post was a joke no need to get angry about it,1
This is the fastest I have regained my senses after my nap to look at the trailer before anyone spoils the name for me.,1
Ew a republican ,0
"Yet some smartasses on this sub want him booted off the next Ant-Man film and want the director to throw the entire spotlight upon Wasp. Something to do with fulfilling some symmetry/equality bullshit. After having such a prominent role in Endgame, Ant-Man is not going to be relegated to being a small time player again in this franchise.",2
You're our only hope!,1
Why knock something if people enjoy it?  It's their money and if they have it to spend what's the big deal?  Dude wants to watch it 15 times let them!  You're here so I'm assuming you watched all 22 movies at some point in your life time at a price...?,0
"Yes, past self. He was a Hero.",3
">few seconds earlier Well, I think the snap that brought them back was a good 20 minutes ago. I think the  Winston Churchill  of this battle was Dr Strange, who communicated to everyone to gear up and draw up battle lines, and organised the sorcerers to portal them to the Avengers compound.",1
"I m gonna go and say that Loki was never gone. His whole interaction with Thanos makes zero sense to me.  Ok, this guy just knocked out the Hulk. I m sure I can take him down with an obvious attack with a little knife. I don t think it s quite a stretch that the God of Mischief would be able to get one over on Thanos. ",1
Those same people were already complaining about her not smiling enough. I seriously doubt she lost Marvel more than a minuscule number of potential audience members. ,2
"Hi Kevin, first of all, thank you very much for all you've done with the MCU! These 11 years have been an amazing ride, I am so happy to be able to participate in this! x200B My question is, did you get emotional when you watched Endgame and saw Tony Stark die on screen for the first time?",3
Yes. I should have expanded the comments be fore commenting. My bad.,1
Hi Kevin!! I have a couple questions: 1. What made you guys decide to go with Sam taking on Cap s legacy instead of Bucky? 2. What s the best memory you have of working with RDJ? 3. What was that clanking noise at the end of Endgame when the Marvel logo came on the screen?  Have a great day!!  ,1
RIP Stan the Man,1
"Avatar also made a lot of money by pushing 3D tickets, which are more profitable.",2
I would have LOVED that. Bc they weren t really avenging anything until this movie. ,3
"Definitely would be awesome. Though I think this upcoming movie will be about Wanda finding a way through the multiverse to find Vision, only to open some kind of multiverse gate that allows in all types of scary horrific multiverse beings (such as ones from Blades universe  ) ) and he has to find a way to send them all back and shut it down, simultaneously dealing with a pained overpowered Wanda.",1
Fucking hell. This hits home. What a great man and character. RIP,1
I'd like to sign up for the !RedditParticipationAward or maybe !RedditCertificateofAttendance ,3
"not that it was shoehorned just showing a bit more wakanda, nice shot of shuri and the dora milaje etc. doesn't matter, i'm super hype. i think im done watching anything more i'm gonna save it for the movie!",2
"Yes, two more films. Tom can sign on for more if he wants to but that s up to him.",1
No. This was the director's cut.,2
Hi Kevin was it hard to pitch the ending for Infinity War?,1
Huh maybe I got my comment threads mixed up. Not gonna check but yeah,0
FYI Jeff Ford is the person who suggested  *I am Iron Man*  when Endgame is in the cutting room.,3
"Damn, sorry that you got downvoted for this. ",1
"Hey Kevin. I don t have any questions for you, I just wanted to say,  Thank you.  for helping turn these characters into an important part of everyone s life.",1
Ugh everyone's gonna snap back then we're gonna be happy then somebody's dying and we'll cry again.  I'm scared but excited,3
They're fucking cockroaches.,1
It's a very real issue.,0
"Unfortunately, yes.",0
bEtSY!!,1
I loved that movie too. Top 10 for me but not top 5. Not for anything bad its just that i love others more,1
"Rhodey was Best Man, while Happy probably gave the Pepper away or maybe even married them, for Pepper it wouldn't have been any of the heroes probably just an unseen friends but for fun I'm going to say Leslie Bibb",2
"Marvel standard There's way too much CGI in these movies, it's bound to have scenes that look like shit.",0
"> A niece is the descendant of Peggy s sibling Not always. A niece could also be the descendant of her husband s siblings. However, Peggy Carter and Sharon Carter are presumably related by more than marriage, given the last name and closeness. And, yeah, Steve wasn t genetically related to Sharon at any point in any timeline. Still going to be super weird for him if she exists in the other timeline and he has to watch her grow up and he s her uncle (again, by marriage, but still).",3
Master of Karate and friendship for everyone!,1
"Yeah, I want them to make Black Widow so fuckin badass that it makes me wanna be a woman. BUT I don't want the film to be completely joyless and grim, this ain't the DCEU",3
AND A HELICOPTER (this would make my day),2
GET ME PICTURES OF SPIDER-MAN!,1
Jeremy Renner should play Johnny Cage based on that signature.,1
Okay. Holy shit. I m blown away. That was AWESOME! You are super talented at editing! I hope to be that good one day!,1
Damn I want Ruffalo to stay,2
I'm sorry.  If I could take it back I would :(,3
Someone call doctor strange and tell him to get out of my mom,1
"Overall, I'd call it good. Not the most creative, but competent. Thanos *was* fantastic motion capture, and made it almost completely across the uncanny valley, seeing as the only distinctly non-human parts were the purple color and the weird chin. Now, if you want to talk about BAD effects in Infinity War, you have to bring up how Bruce Banner looked in the Hulk Buster armor. Someone royally screwed up when they were lighting him and/or the armor",1
What is something you really want to improve with the company/products?,1
One of the best jobs I ve ever seen an actor do. Truly amazing. ,3
Let's keep gilding this so it gets seen,2
You ve managed to squash the joke.,2
ITT: I have no idea what is happening here but I fucking love all of it,0
"His cameo in CM was himself in 1990s practicing for his cameo in the movie  Mallrats . What this means is that this confirms that in the MCU there is a Stan Lee who writes comic books (wether he writes about MCU heroes is a different question). If that s not confusing enough, MCU Stan Lee is also an informant to the Watchers (as seen in GOTG2). Meaning Stan Lee is both a inter dimensional, time traveling informant, while at the same time being a Stan Lee in the MCU",3
"Jesus, the Russos' visual panache definitely scales to the material. The one or two shots of Hulkbuster here are better than its entire Age of Ultron appearance. And that final shot? Rhodey and Bucky and Widow and Cap and Hulk and Okoye and Panther? Goddamn glorious.",1
So do you think that once you become famous you can't enjoy shit that the plebs enjoy?,2
"Sure but how's he gonna learn about it? And if he does, what's to say fighting thanos isn't a bigger risk than that? And hell, who's to say those stones would even count a higher being like him as a potential target? Evil people are dumb. Regardless he's not likely to have actually factored into thanos' plans in the way that Odin could have.",3
"Enjoy!  Not my favorite of his, but I still enjoyed it.  I'd probably rate it similarly to Arrival.",1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcMBFSGVi1c,3
And the shark... has been jumped...,0
"You sound like you'd be really into big Michael Bay movies. Those are nothing but action and your brain won't hurt so much from being used. No need to be a twat, go enjoy some garbage!",1
"At least we got the  SNAP  reference, if not happened in the ending of the movie",1
"It's not unreasonably far in the opposite direction. Most of the women are armored up the way most of the male heroes are, and that's what makes the most logical sense for battle.",3
You know who we still haven't seen? Death. Is she in this or will she be more of an abstract concept?,1
The hulk would be too big and would cover the fallen on the top,1
And still flopped at the box office.,2
"I just appreciate it b/c they ve basically removed sex   romance from the MCU, so a scene that is basically like  we just had a one night stand  is really line-stepping in a fun way. Now that Quill is effectively single again for GOTG3, it would be interesting to explore that a bit   given that Gamora was a clear stabilizing force for him",3
That looks promising. Also included the typical modern trailer sounds.,1
" 67 percent of the top critics reviewing the 100 highest-grossing movies in 2017 were white males  less than a quarter were white women  less than ten percent were underrepresented men. Only 2.5 percent of those top critics were women of color. Am I saying that I hate white dudes? No I m not, but what I am saying is if you make a movie that is a love letter to a woman of color, there is an insanely low chance that a woman of color will have a chance to see your movie and review your movie. ",2
Bye Wade!,3
"Uuummm... Captain marvel... Why did you only kneel AFTER you turned around and saw the other two doing it? Like, everyone else is doing the whole 'respecting a heroic sacrifice thing' and yet cap marv apparently needed the power of peer pressure.",0
Oh thank God.,1
That and Thor seemed to be crying too.,3
I miss fit Thor,1

"The two armies running at eachother remind me of the charge of the rohirrim, so epic! ",1
If you have to ask you can't afford it,1
Her signature is John Hancock levels of taking space. ,3
"I think Carol would be generally be against TAHITI. It s similar to what the Kree did to revive her after the explosion and implanting a false life serving Starforce and the Supreme Intelligence. I m sure she doesn t want anyone to go through that same process. Although perhaps she may reason abit with what Fury did (due to the years apart and maturity perhaps), as he was only trying to keep the Avengers together and safe. Plus Coulson was saved in the process, and look what good things came from that..",3
 ***MY GOOSEBUMPS GOT GOOSEBUMPS***,1
Now I want an Infinity Hammer...,2
Lol found a snowflake,3
Using Stan Lee's Twitter for promotion is literally something he asked for before dying.,1
"Same actress though, she dies in both episodes.",1
"Stan. Thank you for all your work, you really inspired me.",1
But Tonys parents!! /s,2
"Temporarily but the snap isn't a permanent solution. Also it's an awful thing to do, who is Thanos to make that decision on behalf of the entire universe?",1
"> We still have almost no idea what it is about. Ahh, good old trailers. Where the point was to give you a general idea of the plot, who's generally in it, and get you hyped. Not show you a 3 minute preview/review of the film.",2
He's a 5 star Titan!,1
I agree and honestly give credit to Sony for not giving into the pressure that Disney was applying to them. Sure change the deal a little but 50  is a LOT.,3
"Tempting, but i'll join Shield as a secret Hydra agent to infiltrate the avengers and do cool stuff like that.",1
keep you going at what? and who dat thicc chicc?,0
"Meh I disagree, having the hulk subplot during the movie would ve sucked us out of the movie.",2
This is the best man.,1
"I think Thor is one of the most interesting characters in the entire series. We ve so much drastic and real change throughout the last ten years in not only his tone but personality as a whole.  At first however, he wasn t very favorited by fans by a long shot. At what point did you and the rest of the writers finally sit down and decide that Thor as a character needed change? And did you consider these changes to be a big risk when first put into effect?",1
Ok who opened a portal to alternate universes?,2
 It will be good now  3,1
"It could be that  everyone  is hyperbolic as well. Nick Fury, Maria Hill, Happy Hogan, Pepper Potts, etc. aren't exactly as heavy battle material in comparison to the Guardians or Avengers.",3
"They did my boy right. He's my favorite member of the Order, and he looks *frightening* here.",1
Wait that's what he said? I'm actually retarded. I thought he said  some people MOW LAWNS. ,2
"This is niiiiice, I thought the fonts at the top were a mistake at once but saw that they match with the official logos. Damn I want this.",2
when will agents of shield and all of its fans be rewarded by acknowledgement in the MCU?,1
National the last Jedi Lampoon style ,2
I can't believe Thanos took everything he did from Thor - including his fashion sense. ,1
"When falcon reaches cap on the coms, before the portals even started opening a woman behind me said  oh my god...  and then, what I assume, proceeded to wail and cry for the next several minutes.  And I don t blame her.",3
Waititi u say? I say wainotiti,1
That didn't look like a Jericho missile  ,3
Hoe different,0
"It is fair enough- and to their credit these films are pretty generous in their efforts to preserve the false reality... ... I mean, I'm happy with quantum time paradoxes... but not happy with Barton wearing a leather vest... I should just have some more popcorn",2
Can't wait to see captain Marvel and Thor team up ,1
Watch Agents of SHIELD.,0
"I thought so too, but then she's seen in space without her helmet at the end of her movie.",2
"I m glad they nerfed him, the mcu doesn t need a Superman. They need people with flaws and struggles otherwise it s just boring.  Powers can t substitute for personality.",1
           ,1
"I think the studios only get about 50-55  of gross on average (with the rest going to theaters), so if a movie makes  700m on a  230m budget that's more like 700x.55 - 230 =  155m. And some countries they get a lot less (China is capped at 25 ) so if a large portion of that  700m is from China, they may have not actually made much money at all. ASM only made  262m domestic.",1
"Finally, thank god. I can't help but feel like this was just an elaborate ploy to get people more hyped tho.",1
"Is there a correlation between Aldrich Killian's discovery, in Iron Man 3, of the section of the brain that he believed needed to be upgraded and the experiments that gave Quicksilver   Scarlet Witch their powers? And could this be the backdoor to Mutants if, say, that part of the brain evolved on its own?",1
If I trust anyone with Thor I trust Taika. Also the most likely director to just say fuck it and bring back Loki and all the other supposedly truly dead characters.,1
Yeah maybe she just called Nick Fury a slur,1
He doesn't have Hugh Jackman's natural gruffness.,3
"Important to note that since Thanos has all the other Stones at that point, he can amplify their powers with the Power stone and do things they might not be able to do on their own.",3
since Gunn is working with both DC and Marvel... GET YOU A MAN WHO CAN DO BOTH,3
"Yeah, nah, I get it. Just not a Marvel guy, only saw this on the top of r/all. Very clearly something a lot of people enjoyed. I just have no connection to these characters so its just 2:30 of well assembled cuts from different movies so kind of just visual white noise to me.",1
I'm pleasantly surprised the title wasn't spoiled for me before seeing this... Goosebumps to the max right now.,1
"Steve and Tony both saying  Whatever it takes. I don t expect one of them to survive this movie and no matter what, I m not gonna be ready for either of them to die :(",1

"Katheryn Winnick (the badass from Vikings) would have been perfect IMO. That being said, Brie is pretty awesome",1
That creepy future where an AI robot counts as a life.,2
"I think he means  realism  in the sense of practicality, not literally realistic.",1
"That's exactly what I said. The jokes worked in Ant Man, the branding didn't really take away from the movie. It just seems any time you say *anything* critical about product placement you get somebody like the guy above me willing to die on the product placement hill defending it.",1
"You know, that sorta makes sense to me.  Inhumans and mutants are both different species from humans that have random superpowers.  But the main mutants heroes are minorities persecuted by society.  With the Inhumans, the ruling class are the leaders and heroes.  I can kinda see how that could appeal to an oligarch like Perlmutter",3
The way Hulk has been handled in the MCU has been one of their very few failures honestly. Ruffalo went from playing a tortured soul to a comic relief. I have no problem with Banner becoming more comfortable with his plight but it s been a less than memorable transition,3
" Oh yeah, that's Carol, she's the pr girl ",1

I'm thinking Iron and Nebula will be saved by Valkyrie and the remaining Asgardians. ,1
Will we be getting some kind of mega documentary on the Infinity Saga behind the scenes/making of?  I love in depth series docs like Never Sleep Again (Nightmare on Elm Street). There's so much meat on the bone and only basic featurette stuff in the releases. I'd love in depth BTS pre-production thru post production breakdown on the choices made and not made etc.,1
"I think how cap was so surprised and disbelieving of the video shows it's been some time, enough that they searched for a while, given up and counted him as dead. ",1

My guess is x-men as well,2
Decimation means to kill 1 for every 10. I think they would be thankful for those percentages at this point.,3
"But he needs to be punished for it. And the punishment must fit the crime. And cannot be walked back upon. And liberals cannot be complicit in the walking back.  If you combine all of these with the indignity of those terrifying tweets--- pop quiz: would you let your son or daughter near anyone who made such jokes?---you'll see what Disney belatedly, and perhaps disingenuously, saw. Mike Cernovich doesn't enter into it. Even a stopped clock.",0
"Nope that dude replied, he s actually a cuckold",1
WOO,2
"not necessarily, think about historical dramas",1
Voltron! You re thinking of Voltron!,2
A paycheck (not saying that s the only reason they do stuff but they re good directors that can direct action).,2
"No, because they re contracted by the first movie. Besides Ed Norton, that s how it s gone.",1
Also what a perfect film to introduce more LGBT+ characters to the MCU! ,0
"Even if that were the case, it's not a plot hole just a character making a bad decision.",1
Timothy Olyphant is my choice,1
Deadpool is in the main X-men universe. Don t know where you got that from. The X-men universe itself does have an extremely loose continuity but all the films fit in there.,2
"And it's not a good deal for Sony. They'd pay more, and gain less, while Disney profits even more from having Spidey in the mcu, the solo movies, and the merchandise.",3

Hey Kevin! How was the process of finding and putting in a comic like guardians of the galaxy into the marvel cinematic universe. At the time it was a pretty unknown comic and its crazy how they are now one of the biggest parts of the universe. Are you able to reveal the next phase of marvel movies yet as well or is that strictly under wraps? Thank you for coming to reddit today!,1
Do you have any source for Marvel owning the Peter Parker (not Spider-Man) rights? I don t see why Peter Parker would be separate from Spider-Man in Sony s contract.,1
"fair enough, but you too are an asshole based on merrit. so draw.",1
Someone else commented the same thing ahahaha,1
"I'm okay with being able to figure out the general structure of the film,but that movie basically told you the entire plot of the movie. Like you could not have seen the movie and just watched the trailers and I bet you'd be either right on or close to figuring out most of the plot. ",1
"awwww, look at her little boots",3
Got this one too.,2
And how much did it cost? Big stars charge a ton at Cons.,3
"I felt like Maestro is what Endgame was alluding to. Smart Hulk is just so righteous, forward and even aloof in that movie. He didn't even want to try building the machine until Black widow sweet talked him. He pretty much ignored Cap why they were at the table.  I could see the Death of Nat, the effects of the gauntlet and the loneliness of all the other original Avengers being gone except (Hawkeye who he really has no relationship with) leading him into being a darker character.",2

My question is, if there was a character from a universe outside of Marvel or even Disney that you could work into the MCU, what would it be?

Her friend hadn't watched a single Marvel film (apart from I think Homecoming?) nor were they familiar with the MCU as a whole. Cut to about a year later, and my sister actually got her really invested in the franchise, watching all the films from Iron Man 1 up to the present. Infinity War was talked about as such a cool and emotional experience, that I guess it got her interested in how it got to that point.",1

DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!! CAP HAD A SHAVE DAMNIT,3
I like that theorized storyline there...but just swap Deadpool for Daredevil and I think we have a more plausible scenario.  Plus...far more likely Fury would work with Daredevil.,1
What bothers me is the relationships and arcs they do choose to focus on though. Cap is the classic example where we get 3 movies focusing on his relationship with Bucky and 2 movies with him bonding with Black Widow but his iconic comic relationship with Agent 13 gets no attention at all to the point where he goes back in time to be with Peggy.,3
Hell yeah! That's sick!,1

Somewhere online I saw the title Ant man and the Wasp and Stinger to and that sounds like a really fun title. Edit: It could be a movie about Stinger being a superhero but instead of the stereotypical I m trying to protect my daughter you can t be a hero cliche. It could be a movie about how Scott is accepting from the jump and his daughter dies well as a superhero. Then subvert expectations and instead of Stinger getting hurt Scott could get hurt and it is now Stinger who worries about him.,2

"The gods are fucking smart if that's the case, Akira should not be remade under and circumstances. It's basically impossible for them to not fuck it up, and even if by some miracle they don't there's still no way to improve on the original.",2

Avengers: Whatever it takes.,1
"Great seeing if not a little over the top. But isn't that what comic book movies are all about in the end? Either way I can kind of see why they cut the scene, and simultaneously don't get it. All I know is between Gamora Captain America and Doctor Strange, I can't decide who I liked better",1
No thanos did the snap. Food and supplies are now plentiful!,1
Even if Gunn isn't a pedophile (I do believe that he is but that's besides the point) he's a really fucked up person. Go read the synopsis for Tromeo which he helped work on. ,0
"Whenever people try to say disliking Jane Foster has anything to do with her being a girl, I always think of Frigga and how everyone wishes she had gotten more to do in the Thor films.  Lady Sif too.",3

they did it with pym lab and legos and aaa batteries.,1
So is Cap Marvel invisible to humans? Is that why noone knows about her? I cant tell whats up. Also why didnt Nick Fury ever mention her to Tony   Co? mustve been some special secret,2
I heard he pressed his chin against a grate to get the indentions ,3
Dont lump incontinent people with verbally incontinent people lol.,1
"The difference is: Red Sparrow was shit. Even one of the main aspects, the Russian accent of Jennifer Lawrence, was bad. I'm sure that the Black Widow movie will be of much higher quality.",1
"I don't think my girlfriend could handle that on a mental and emotional level. She's a bit of a cryer. After IW she cried, of course, and I thought she was good to go. Then we're on the way home and she just breaks down again. While she was driving. Like, ugly crying. We almost crashed. If they show his family turning to dust she might just check out completely. Come to think of it, I don't think I could handle that.",3
"I mean, it could be... are you sure about that? How do you know for sure? ",2
Damn. Absolutely breaks my heart to hear this.,1
"We are already there.  Women have been in leading roles and roles in general for a LONG time and getting paid more than any of us will ever make.  So I just dont see the reasoning it was such a big deal to market this movie as some sort of women are held back and I, Brie Larson, am your savior.  ",0
Definitely messing with him... probably the same as keeping a boot on a dogs neck and watching it struggle. Morbid curiosity and all that.,1
"I wish I had saved the gold points from my Platinum here so I could give you gold, cause remembering my comment from 2 months ago just to answer something like this kinda deserves gold.",1
It was the fact that they revealed Spider-Man when he originally was supposed to be a suprise.,1
First: This is amazing!!! Second: How many comic conventions do you go to?,2
"I doubt Disney would be investing on a bunch of sequels to Avatar if they thought the only draw was the 3D tech Rather than risk a flop where nobody cares enough for the re-release, where they also have to split money with the theaters and take a spot away from their already chock-full schedule  It's much safer and beneficial to release in Disney+, where anyone interested can watch, and all the profits go to Disney  bonus points for not having to compete with themselves at the BO.",1
Hi Kevin thanks for taking the time today... Now how do you feel about Don Cheadle playing adult miles Morales for the live adaption of spiderman into the human-verse.,0
Thanks for sticking...to...your...gunns,1
"I liked him in Dallas buyers, suicide squad, American psycho, reqium, and fight club /s",1
"Ah, I was wrong. Not confirmed, but just rumoured. Thanks!",1
I mean this could very easily be the difference between 4K HDR and just 1080p.,1
"Avatar, we've bargain to come",2
Would be tough given the time constraints. The way they develope them in the show works because it's such a slow burn. Unless your making a four hour movie your probably not getting kingpin egg cracking or looking through suits scenes which are really great scenes in the show. ,3
any second now ,1
"Hi Kevin, In Avengers: Endgame, what happens to Scott s exwife and her boyfriend/husband?  They never appear and it seems as though Scott and Hope end up with Cassie at the end.",2
"You asked a question,  I answered it.  You don't know the answer, so mine is as good as any other right now.",1
"Nice, they had the costumes on.",1
If they secure a January release date for 2026 it'll be just in time for my birthday. My birthday never gets any tentpole movies,1
.I still hadn't realized who the fuck he was in lotr...,1
"I mean in IW he specifically points out that it s not attached to him anymore, it seemed to be just part of his jacket/shirt. Now at this point there s not enough suit left to warrant doing it for that reason. He says food and water ran out 4 days ago so maybe it has some kind of life support system to it? I wouldn t be surprised if he had some way for it to attach to him directly to feed him nutrients or something",1
"This isn't 1987, we'll be fine (I hope)",1
"Hi Kevin, don't know if you'll see this one but here's hoping. I have two questions I can think of 1. What are the biggest inspirations unrelated to marvel that have influenced your decision making regarding the MCU and in what way did they affect it. 2. HOW did cap get back to our reality? Thanks for everything",1

I'm sorry was that not what they did for IW? He looked so real it couldn't have been CGI,1
But Officer... He said he was 15. Free joke for you.  Feel free to use that.  It's called subverting expectations.,1
They are probably under contracts which would make things way more complicated than just trying to sit out.,1
It is also the only other show to be really connected to AoS,1
And they can keep him separate from the MCU,0

"Yeah, you could tell he was clearly uncomfortable in the BTS videos everyone uploaded after Endgame premiered",2
I love Marvel for going all out on these costumes.  Remember when Fox put all the XMen in black leather and then told everyone that yellow spandex just could never work on the big screen.  For years afterwards all comic book movies followed suit and it truly sucked.   I love that mysterio costume.,1
I haven't seen it in decades and I recognized it :D,2
"Well no, Raimi isn't still working for them anymore, but someone else will. And whether or not Spiderman is part of a big interconnected universe, the movies will make billions. The MCU wouldn't change that. It's possible that they haven't learned from their mistakes, but again, ITSV is a very good sign. I guess I'm less cynical about a Sony-led future of Spiderman than the rest of you.",1
I m sure there was a behind the scenes clip that came out with RDJ with the cloak? Makes me wonder how close they got to actually filming this.,1
Great news. My one concern is that its only a 2 picture deal just so Feige can give Spider-Man a proper exit from the MCU. Does that mean we're going to have to go through this song and dance again 2-4 years from now?,1
I m just a dude playing a dude disguised as an iron dude!,1
">Quake would ve been super helpful, could ve quaked the entire battle field That might not have been a good idea.

If she was shaking the ground that river would have filled in the hole for sure.",1

How much quality can a shirt have?  even if it was hand sewn it couldn't justify the cost. they don't have magic space cotton or use unicorn hairs for thread. ,1
"That's what my friend asked. When I was telling him about everything that was announced, he said  Doctor Strange, Loki, and What If look cool but who the fuck are Shang Chi and the Eternals?  He said he's sort of checked out of the MCU at this point but I'll see how that changes once he sees them. Edit: I want to clarify I'm excited for Shang-Chi and Eternals. My friend is not. Why did I get downvoted?",1
"For the first time, Mark Ruffalo isn't the one spoiling something",1
I am  having these flashes of memory ,1
There s even people who thought the X-Men movies were in the MCU lol.,3
Captain Marvel probably saves them. At the end of her movie it showed her using her lightspeed power to move a Skrull ship a great distance away from the Kree empire. So we know she can move a huge distance rapidly and she can also relay that speed to a spaceship to transport others,0

They said the same thing with Captain Marvel that it's not like your typical Marvel movie but hey we'll see.,1
"If he does come back, it would probably be a while from now",3
They can. Doesn't mean they should though. Even bringing 2014 Gamora back feels like a cop-out to me.,3

I hope Deadpool stays rated R in solo films but for crossovers Id imagine they d have to tone him down a bit.

"What? If you make public, easily findable jokes, get hired, and get fired years later it s absolutely your employer did something wrong.

Thank you for this. ,1
>tired of losing discs and them getting scratched Are you 5? Lol,2
"I can see that, but I don't see Disney wanting that to happen. Not after what happened with their animated films. I think they have the experience at this point to help Marvel ensure that they won't have to go through that themselves and find a way to  solve  that problem before it happens.",1

Rest in Peace Stan Lee. Thank you for being part of the minds behind so many childhood heroes and favorite characters. ,3
"Hi Kevin! Thank you for all the hard work you have put into the MCU over the last 11 years, you have truly made many people s childhood dreams come to life! So I have two quick questions: What is your favorite scene or moment from all of the movies that have been released? There have been a lot of great casting choices for these characters, if you could choose a character that hasn t had a movie yet who would you pick and who would you cast for the role?",1
"Captain, as far as I m concerned, that s America s ass.",1
He was in the running for a while iirc,1
"Hey Kevin, what was your favorite moment over the duration of the Infinity saga?",1
But but but I REALLY need him to direct a superhero movie I like so it's ok!,2

From a pragmatic perspective, why wouldn t you basically make every non-enhanced individual into an iron man variant the same way war machine and pepper do? It s not for lack of suits or funding.",3
"Hello Kevin, first is amazing what have you and the whole team have made the last 10 year. I'd like to know, which is your favorite character of marvel and if he, she or it hasnt appear on any movie, are there any plans for he, she or it to appear. Sorry if my english is bad. Thanks",1

Nah bro. Remember in the second one the characters of the XMEN First Class generation were in the xmansion in a room behind Deadpool while he was talking shit about the studio not splurging to get more recognizable characters to make a cameo. And they just quietly closed the door to their room before Deadpool could notice them.,3
"How does he look like a hypocrite? How is letting the cast speak about it disrespectful? I mean, all the cast said was  We like Gunn, but we want to stay employed at Disney so we're going to move on from this. ",1

He can't rewind time to before he got the time Stone. That would result in him not acquiring the Stone. Same reason why if Wanda destroyed the mind stone before thanos got the time Stone he wouldn't be able to get it.,2

"The only reason I fear for Thor is that Avengers 3+4 were already written by the time Ragnarok came out so they didn't know Ragnarok would have the impact it did... x200B ...though even without Ragnarok, IW did such an amazing job with Thor that I think people would be begging for a new movie for him anyways. Also its pretty much a given that Cap and/or Tony will die, so killing off Thor wouldn't do him justice as his death just wouldn't have the same impact as the other two.",1

 What did it cost?   Everything.  ,1
"Yes- he started his hunt because he knew where the other stones were. The reason he went to Xandar is because he finally had a path to get all six.

"In the second situation you re projecting a lot of intent that just isn t there.  Cold, uncaring and hostile  are weird adjectives to use to describe something that isn t inherently sentient - the universe is just  there. It doesn t feel one way or the other about us.  So, yeah, I feel your question is a tad loaded. I m quite comfortable with the notion that there s nothing after death. And no, that doesn t mean I want to die. Quite the opposite. ",1

I always felt it was implied. We know at least in ironman two that the new version of the arc reactor is made using his dad's notes and Howard had the stone for years so it seems plausible. Would also explain why the chest reactor stopped Loki from using the staff on Tony in Avengers. If the infinity stones seem to negate each others effects to a degree,3
"Mostlikely. This is my concern too. I think Feige s comments about Sony still working on their Spider-verse, and Spider-Man being the first  cross universe  character kind of alludes to that.

"It s because Marvel movies tend to use pop songs in their advertising. Where most movie franchises with recognizable music use those songs in advertising.

"Hey Kevin, One question from Endgame that s been bothering me for a while is was Cap always worthy?

I was just thinking of this quote lol.,1
I don't thing Ronan *used it* before putting in the hammer which I think is the big difference,1
"Kevin, Did you sit down and outline the entire arc for all the Marvel phases before it all began, or did you more or less start with the first phase and let it mature and then decide what directions to go based on feedback/reception?

"Anything shot digitally since at least 2012 has been 4K or higher. 4K digital cinema cameras aren t that expensive, and honestly neither are 6K or 8K cameras in the grand scheme of things. Either way, cameras are usually rented, not purchased outright. For example, the recent Avengers movies were filmed in 6.5K resolution on the Arri Alexa 65 camera. The reason these movies are in 2K is because they were edited and mastered in 2K. So that 6.5K footage was downscaled to 2K.",2

"Probably because you got conditioned to expecting some arrogance to come with the genius, given that Tony Stark is the prototypical first genius we all got introduced to in the MCU. Banner is at his level but he doesn't push his ideas the way Tony does. He actually feels a little more grounded as I find his quiet demeanor far more similar to a lot of our real-world's top minds/brains in research.",3

"Pretty much every Marvel property was in some stage of development in the 90s. The fact that Blade was the first to get a major film is proof that popularity was not a factor. Blade was a supporting character in Tomb of Dracula, a member of an ensemble book that ended up cancelled, and a solo series that was cancelled after about ten issues.  And yet, movie deal.  So yeah, popularity was definitely a huge consideration. There were no characters more popular than Blade in the 90s. /s",1

We have about six Spidey villains at this point, even if most are little mundane at this point, so they may fill the roster with minor villains like Shocker and Tinkerer. Ideally Mysterio is alive for this. Or maybe the Sinister Six will be in the future marvel movie they ve mention and make it a crossover with one or more younger/minor heroes.",1

"It definitely seems to have lost some of its charm. I went regularly for the early part of the last decade. I went once last year and it felt different, and not fun.  They need to downsize it or more it somewhere more reasonable, even for sdcc, the lines were particularly bad.

Or it's not Cap.,3
"I can kinda see what you're getting at with their Avengers movies (even though I think there are some clear differences in how they approach it vs. how Whedon did), but their work on the Cap movies feels pretty distinct from the rest of the MCU, especially Winter Soldier.",0
> where the target audience was women of color. > less than 22  of the reviews were from the target audience. Well....  I mean only 6  of Americans are black women.  So 22  is actually a statistically pretty high number. Also spending 100 million dollars to make a movie that only 6  of the population is allowed to have an opinion on is a monumentally stupid business decision.,0

It was the first shot the russo brothers got for marvel and they did a really good job in helping ground the mcu as a whole through that and what followed. Plus it helped change caps image since the first one was a little campy. He's still got those roots, but he has probably the best character development outside of Tony and it's a lot in thanks to ws",2

Hi Kevin. Are the Netflix Marvel shows part of the MCU timeline that we've known from the past 22 movies? Or are they from a different reality/earth?,1

i wouldve killed to see tony and strange swap suits. wish it was during the final battle instead of the ship tho,2
That's a Tetris cartridge 100 ,3
"Idk why these things have to turn into a DC hating fest every time as I honestly love Man of Steel, and think Aquaman and Shazam both look way more appealing than Captain Marvel so I d set those as benchmarks lol.  but that s besides the point. I totally get what you re saying though it is good to set benchmarks, it s just the first comment sounded like  hold out for Avengers, then do it .   ",1

"Idea: Awesome Execution: Impeccable Music: ...eh. Really amazing stuff.  The music brings it down a bit though.  It's so dull, repetitive, and anti-climactic and doesn't really maintain the pace the editing sets. Otherwise, fantastic stuff u/leunnam OP: Hopefully to make my criticism a bit more constructive,  here's an example of how music can really drive the micro-story you're telling.

Its interesting how you will only refer to pedophilia as the  joke .,3
And that's a high quality trailer. My absolute only complaint is the lack of Skrulls. Pretty sure the old lady at 1:30 is one btw.,1
">  All the MCU movies are solid Solid in a good way too, usually. Well.. Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor 2 were honestly relatively meh. But for a series of 20+ movies, that's a great record to have.",2

Doctors refer to themselves as doctors all the time dummy. They didn't go to medical school all those years so they can say hi I'm Bob.,1

Hi Kevin! Thank you so much for this AMAA! 2 quick questions: -We re you into Marvel comic books when you were younger? Did you have a favorite? -Who is your favorite hero or villain that isn t in the MCU? Thanks!,1
SO FRICKIN AMAZING,1
With what cameras were Infinity War and Endgame shot?,1

" You fumble the Infinity Gauntlet, I will break my Ant-Man off in your John Brown hind parts...  then you will run a mile. ",2
Plus it undermines the character development Hulk/Banner goes through in Endgame.,3
Yes that was the point,1
Watch it again. Banner/Hulk are both absent from this trailer. I think Iron Man and Nebula being in that shot are a ruse. ,0
"He's not a con man, he wouldn't do that",0

"Don't feel alone, we will all be right behind you my man. Stay positive, have fun, love everyone with all your heart. Cheers to you and yours!",1
"Damn you right, you right",1
Is there a plan to slowly build up another large overarching narrative (such as the infinity saga) or will you be taking a break from that sort of storytelling and focusing on smaller scale stories and dealing with the fallout of endgame for awhile?,1
What would be your advice to aspiring producers?,1
"Space suits, for space, I guess. I hope it's not for the final battle, I don't want Cap to die dressed that ugly.",0
I guess that is what he really wanted from Hunter.,1
No thats Tony.  Clint is there too.,2
"Seems like when they recruit these people for their roles that there has to be some standard like  you gotta be prepared to go all in for it . Like do this type of stuff. I can hardly think of actors that do this type of stuff. Then again, Marvel's something else right.",3
"Kinda a throwaway question, but do you have a favorite hat?",2
Lol this was in my head as well.,1
"I don't think so.  They seem to play pretty loose with Cap's strength in the MCU.  He was able to pull Spidey off balance, prevent that helicopter from taking off, and lift a huge girder off Bucky.   I think surprising Thanos for a second before getting smacked down makes sense in the MCU.",1
Thank the gods for Tony. And his scraps,3
"Hi Kevin,  Is there any plans for the tv series to make a appearance on the big screen?",1
"Ugh, I really struggled through Iron Man 3. The whole time I was thinking,  who thought this was a good idea?  I think I preferred Thor 2. Spoilers ahead?  Exploding people, random kid, Tony is basically James Bond, Pepper is a ninja, iron man suits are now made of paper mache, and Stark tosses the new element he discovered into the ocean. ",2
2. Thor can be seen walking right in front of Widow and where Tony would be in the Superbowl tv spot,2
Thank God everyone can't shut the hell up about it,0
I m lost. Can someone explain this to me. Shouldn t people be more fucking bummed about his situation?,1
He will be untethered and his rage will know no bounds.,3
"This was awesome.One thing I hope the film really digs into is the after effects of the snap.Think about it,half the worlds population is gone.That could cause so many after effects.Riots,Food crisis,Economy related crisis it's insane.",1
"I d agree if they keep increasing the movie count per year, but the shows aren t really gonna be mainstream enough to contribute that much to oversaturation.",1
Seems like they would have made that known when Disney announced its slate in May. Four years between isn t too crazy anyway.,2
"Thank you, that's cool",1
 Bananas ,1
I figured. Is just bad or is it 'Drag Me To Hell' bad?,1
" Iconic: widely known and acknowledged especially for distinctive excellence (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/iconic) A LOT of people agree that this is one of the best scenes in the MCU, so yes, it is iconic. It doesn't have to be  around long enough to come close to being 'iconic'. ",1
Bruh this picture is so cute,1
I can't imagine the hype. I've only been a fan since the movies. How incredibly fucking pumped are you for this?,3
Yeah this is a waste of time considering the funeral will be the next scene,1
He's being allowed to play in the DC sandbox while also potentially sort of soft rebooting part of it. I only hope he'll find a way to fix that joker cuz yikes. Maybe retcon it so that he's actually Jason Todd or something.,1
Elf to the MCU is that san fran Rat to saving the universe,1
"I disagree with the action, pacing, and comedy. Several months pass so it only feels like he learned his powers too fast. Everything else I agree with",1
Such an amazing suit. I hope we see some variation of her Ms. Marvel suit in the future. Maybe a sleeveless all black outfit with a giant gold star (instead of the lightning bolt),3
Might be some GotG action!,1
I see.,1
Avengers: Fractured But Whole,1
"Try and villianize me all you want. I don t care about either side, I just enjoy the hypocrisy that reddit was celebrating Roseanne being fired and crying about Gunn.",1
That s not what OCD is.,2
"Would be nice to see a hulk movie in the 4 year gap between IW and Endgame.  Have banner experimenting on himself, hulking out a few times, reconnecting with Betty even if just for a moment, all the while hiding himself from what's left of the avengers who disapprove of his public-endangering experimentations. But the whole time knowing he is onto something. Make it dramatic and suspenseful and depressing as hulk solos are supposed to be. The whole movie set in the chaos of the post-snap world.",1
I didn't care for any of the Thor movies. I do like the character Thor though.,1
Gags,3
Just me or does this haircut make him look so much like an ideal Peter Parker like Jesus I have scene it twice and I am still amazed.,1

I am so fucking wet,1
The opening scene at the school. I'm in the room next door to the classroom they're In.,1
Amazing work! I hope you get paid to do this for a living.,1
"You have put it so perfectly here. Always felt his performance in IW was amazing without even considering the glam surrounding his entry in Wakanda. Was never able to explain my thoughts clearly, but this sums it up. He blends different aspects of his character seamlessly.",2
"I agree in the majority, but I'm pretty sure psychopaths, sociopaths and people with god complexes go into that line of work for their own needs/interests/pleasures and have no care for the value of life, more reveling in the idea they can stop death or bring it upon whosoever they choose. But Strange isn't one of them.",1
"They're official posters, released by a studio determined to keep spoilers at a minimum. It's fine.",1
"Lets not kid ourselves, these aren't  fans  its demented right wingers who want to see Gunn suffer for expressing his opinion about trump.  Fucking dirtbags is what they are. ",1
He was Riddick before he became Dom Toledo. What do you expect?,1
Big for Stephen's character though. Besides that it was unnecessary.,1
I think we can put to rest that Scott is in the past or something theory. ,3

"The scene where Captain America is holding Thanos gauntlet, you can see on his gauntlet that he only has the power stone and the space stone so far. ",1
"Hi Kevin, I don't have a question, just wanted to say hi  ",1
Both you and Tom Holland have stated that the little boy from Iron Man 2 was a young Peter Parker. Was this originally planned? Or was it thought later  this would make a great headcanon! ?,1
Why? 38 can be divided by 2 and 17.,2
"There are well over 7 billion people in the world. The answer to  Am I the only one who (stupid thing) ?  is *never*  Yes. Unless you're working on something cutting-edge or whatever, obviously.",1
Bigger question is how Marvel plans to conclude Thor's story without killing him. Will he setup Asgard somewhere and rule from there (plus the occassional cameos in future films?)?,1
So is Ant Man gonna beat Thanos lol,1
foh,1
Alternative title: Korg confirmed for Thor 4,1
Can we have the return of hammerless Thor then? The entirety of Ragnarok was around Thor not needing a hammer then they gave him one back the very next movie.,1
"The only thing that's probably from the ending is Cap's arm in the shield, but it's ultimately just a fucking arm. We don't even know the landscape. I honestly thought the Avengers would unite in Infinity War and that the marketing was just hiding a final battle from us. I was wrong, but it looks like that's what they're doing this time.",3
Evans will always be known as the guy from cellular for me!,2
Lmao I thought that was Blade for some reason ,1
"Because a lot of people, myself admittedly included, actually enjoyed Venom unlike ASM2",1
No More goofy films. I beg,1
Just have magneto experimented on in the concentration camp (perhaps with a proto super soldier serum) which makes him age slowly and enhanced his powers. You can get an actor in their 50s to play him in his 90s. Have Xavier be a slightly younger guy who grew up during the civil rights movement. Xavier doesn't need to be in action scenes so having him be an older actor wouldn't matter too much.,1
Same way how there's Deadpool and Punisher merch...,1
Secret empire could happen. And im hoping for galactus. So it could be renew spidey. Go into secret invasion and dark reign. Then following siege adapt pleasant hill and go into secret empire. Then have doom takeover a little bit and lead into a more ff4  and galactus focussed story,2
Paper beats Rock,1
Beautiful smile!,1
that's pretty interesting,2
Out of the Loop:  is Marvel Comics planning anything special? Edit: anything special with the passing of Stan the Man Lee?,1
Dredd?,0
The fact he lived upto 95 and did movies till then is fucking impressive. A legend amongst legends ,1
This would be so much better if there wasn't an ad for the movie at the bottom.,3
"is this on disney plus? and i m sure the  someone  he s referring to is ultron? i m having trouble remembering, though i just watched it maybe 3 days ago, in AoU i don t remember any intel/lead for QS/SW to go into the church..? so on top of great foreshadowing like you mentioned that s also a good lead to them getting to the church  correct me if i m wrong but i just don t remember any specific sequence that led them there",2

"If this makes you sad, you should take a music appreciation course. There's tons of stuff  hidden  especially in classical music that a casual listener wouldn't know to catch, Der Erlkonig being one of the more famous examples. And then there's this (Salieri's level of appreciation for music itself): https://youtu.be/pxgZcMGmkkI",1
This was an amazing scene. The acting was phenomenal.,1
"Why should she need help specifically from a man in the movie though? She had help from others, doesn't matter if they were male or female. Would you critic a film if a male lead didn't get help from a woman throughout it? Seems like a weird argument point to me",1
All the other kids just turn around ,2
"True.  It s entirely possible, you re right.  Just not economically with today s tech.  But this won t always be the case for sure!",1
"> Respect the source material. Unless it's a villain Edit: To clarify, this wasn't meant as a rude remark, just a lighthearted jab about how the villains almost always stray very far from the source material. It's been better for some and worse for others. I think the only ones that have even been close to being accurate are Red Skull and Loki. Everyone else has had massive changes in appearance, powers, backstory, motivation, etc.",3
New hair color just in time for her own movie am i right,2

I was certainly not being sarcastic. That's obvious. ,0
Ultron just wasn't very threatening imho and even though few jokes were rather unnecessary. I still like AoU a lot but Thanos needs to be handled better,3
That wasn't foam. Rocket has a tool called a Fixer. It fixes metal. He showed it off to Tony in the comics when Ironman joined the Gaurdians in space for a minute.,3
James Cameron smiles looking at Avatar 2 script,1
"Could you just respond to me? I haven t done much but I have huge goals and I ve been truly inspired by your work and the MCU in general. It s just such a positive and happy thing that has brought so many people together and definitely made the world a better place. Congrats on everything! I m sure you ve got more comments then time, but I hope you can see how much and how many you ve helped! Good luck on any future projects!",1
"Pretty cool, but what would the point have been for Strange to have Stark s suit and vice versa?",2
That adds up. I can sleep easy knowing everyone in the world has Evans and Scarjo.,3
If you want to go in almost blind I'd avoid this trailer tbh. It doesn't show anything hugely spoilerly but there's enough. ,1
Or  Valkyrie or Ravagers with Kraglin and his arrow.  Should be pretty good with it by now.,1
This.  Kind of the point of the whole movie.,1
"Occasionally mentioned on reddit isn t the same as people in real life talking about it though. Same way it s *so* cliche to mention Moon on reddit but in reality, basically no one knows what Moon is.",0
The bring me thanos is one the worst lines in cinema history. Sounds so lame and ruined he moment,0
good point.,1
I wonder how many secret polls they carried out asking people the same thing before they went back to the table knowing they would be on the back foot,2

" Next up for Waititi is  *Jojo Rabbit,* (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scarlett-johansson-joins-taika-waititis-world-war-ii-film-jojo-rabbit-1098236) a unique Nazi-era satire he directed for Fox Searchlight, which opens Oct. 18. Scarlett Johansson stars in the picture alongside Waititi, who portrays a boy's imaginary version of Adolf Hitler.    ... are we just brushing this one under the carpet, or has the internet not caught on to this one yet?  almost as good as her portraying a tree.",1

RIP Doctor Strange,3
"I was hoping I wasn t the only one who was most impressed by that.  It flowed so well, just like the Winter Soldier fight.",3
Sony has never looked as good as it does here.,3
"You're acting as if he has to create code and engineer the suit himself. If Rhodey can throw it on and work it in Iron Man 2 without any prior knowledge, then that goes to show the tech to function it is simple. Hulk was already shown with teenage/adolescent intelligence in Ragnarok. He could figure it out.",1
"I mean if you re being sarcastic, cool. It s just hard to tell over the internet.",1
"Right now, BluRay is always going to have higher quality, but streaming is always going to be more convenient. Eventually streaming quality might catch up to hard media, but there are just so many bottlenecks in the pipeline that it ll still probably be a ways a away, but its not like the streaming quality is bad",1
If there s a time jump he could have made some renovations but who knows really.,1
Unreliable narration,2
Good ol Bootista,1
Worthy inclusion,0
I'm not sure I would have been able to take the rest of the movie in good humour if that had been how it started. Thor and Loki's actions would feel less appropriate.  Much better with what we got.,2
GLORIUS!!!!!!!!,1
"He goes to Earth to help the Avengers, confidant they have held their ground in protecting the stones up to this point.  Going to Titan, based on what he knows, likely means facing Thanos alone.  Instead, he wants to force Thanos to come to him, so he alongside the Avengers can fight him as a team. We don't know why he knows Wakanda specifically but if the Black Order can track Vision's mind stone, then perhaps he can too with the aid of Rockets tech.  (Alternatively they tracked the Black Order's ships.)",1
No Disney doesn't otherwise they wouldn't be asking for so much. 50  of the box office and 100  if merchandising in an IP you don't own is a stupid demand. No wonder sony walked. They wanted to renew but Mickey is too greedy.,3
So you're admitting that you don't actually care about any of this and are just pushing it for your own gain? Good job.,0
All caps,3
"And Nega-Scott can be there, just being a really cool, really great guy.",2
So excited. Now I can actually watch endgame!,1
i think thats more likely in a future captain marvel/strange/ black panther movie.,1
"Yeah, I thought so when he or she first made it, and I still think it. One of the best montages of all time.",2
I dont think there is anything as iconic as the opening harry potter theme or the star wars theme or the jaws music. I do wish we had something like that for the franchise,1
There's a chance he might be digitally recreated in the future Marvel movies to keep up the tradition of cameos. 3 months ago he was brought into a studio for several hours that works on Marvel movies that specifically deals in digitally capturing an actor's face to be put on another actor's body.  I hope it does continue.,1
"Lol,  taboo shit . The dude has a job making kids movies and hes posting about gojng to Nambla meetings, among other things. ",1

Does anyone buy physical copies anymore---,0
I'd love that. But that shit ain't happening unless Disney ponies up and buys Fox. Because lord knows Fox refuses to share. ,3
"I think it's going to be different this time because there's no Fox, no Netflix, it's ALL MCU now, all more connected and more similar, tonally and aesthetically, than ever before.",3
Where is Hawkeye? And where is Ant-Man?,1
It should have been Cap on the star and the other original 5 in the blue spaces surrounding the star. It triggers me it's not like that :(  (only Renner is actually in one of the spaces... Don Cheadle and Brie Larson are out of place!),1
 Quantum Quantum,3
I work at a somewhat large hospital in Florida. It takes 24-48 hours for medical record release here. How long it would take to send it to a marvel producer I have no idea but the release doesn t take long at all.,0

Oof got his name wrong! Thanks!,1
"Maybe.... but think about it. We had action for *infinity war* from the very first teaser. We re now two teasers in, and with Feige confirming that they re only using approximately the first 15-20 minutes of the movie to market it, we actually may not get any action at all",1

Not everything should be thethered as they're trying to make it. At this point it seems every Disney+ show will be followed up by a movie (besides What If..?) As long as I can see the film without being confused because I didn't watch the follow-up show I'll be fine. They have ignored the shows too much at this point to finally give them this much spotlight. But I guess it is too early now to comment on how they'll integrate the shows none have been released yet,1

That's exactly what would be said to save face as well. Keep in mind Disney is 100 percent about image. That's why they fired him and that's why they bowed to pressure as rehired him. Just because they say they never even took the firing seriously and didn't even ask other directors does not mean it's truth. I'm not sure why people trust these massive corporations so much,1

Can I ask a question? What does any of that have to do with Disney firing him?  Is he not able to change or move on without working for Disney?  At the end of the day Disney is a kid friendly/family friendly company.  This guy made some hugely crass jokes about pedophilia and everyone is up in arms for Disney firing him?  Is it because it was 10 years later i.e. Disney stood by him until it was made public (again?)?  Did Disney know or not know?,2

"Yes, a LOT of Marvel villains crossover with other superheroes.  Doctor Doom is the biggest one which is why comic fans consider him THE Marvel villain.

Why do they seem so shocked to see Scott at the end. I known it shows him on a screen in the earlier part of the trailer when they talk about losing so many people but there's no way to confirm he was dead. What are the chances them two clips aren't even the same scene?,0
That doesnt even make sense. That's literally just another reason to show action since we know this sadness won't mean anything,1

Plus, depending on what else they announce, this might not be the most hype worthy thing, and it could just get upstaged.",2

"Eh I disagree. Mostly because the asgardians are the only characters that canon NEVER stay dead. That s Loki s entire thing, is actually that he can never truly die and is always resurrected or reborn. We ve already seen evidence of this, with Odin sending messages and shite from the afterlife.

"It's entirely likely that this is going to be a recurring theme in the MCU. The ensuing chaos from everyone being snapped away and then being snapped back, means that criminals have a chance to escape prison and other people are taking advantage of the chaos to commit crime necessitating a rise in superheroes in response.  I'm guessing that's how Zemo escapes and that's how Vulture ends up in a possible Sinister Six movie",2
First of all amazing work here. What is the your process? do you find a clip you like and look for one that will match/counter it? Do you not know for certain until you play them together? (I imagine so). Be proud of yourself for this!,1

"So by my thinking, we'll have Mysterio (and in any likeliness a teaser for the sinister 6), Adam Warlock, and Mordo waiting in the wings for immediate usage. If Stark survives Endgame we might see the real Mandarin. I could plausibly see Skaar being conceived before Ragnarok with some temporal BS aging him up. With the Fox buyout we'll probably see Doom and Magnito before long. Galactus is probably at least teased.",1

"I wish he had two movies: Iron Man 4: Rise of Ultron  Avengers:  Age of Ultron I loved Ultron as a funhouse mirror Tony, and I just didn't get enough of that.  I would have built up Tony's hopes for Ultron harder with Bruce first  with troubling hints that all is *not* well...and ended Iron Man 4 with the Death of Jarvis. Then Age of Ultron would have picked up and followed the original script from that point forward.",2

You get actor's and directors that won't do their best for certain roles and act like why should I bother with their best effort when this is for kids...  If i wanted real life i would go read about that guy that stabbed the drug dealer over drugs recently.,1

He's the one who would be most hurt by losing his role but he's willing to do it anyway because of what Gunn did for him (and in his view it's the right thing to do).,2

Except it wasn t outrage culture. It was an alt-right troll who had made much of the same sorts of jokes on his twitter account as the ones that got Gunn fired.,2
"Lol true. Maybe Feige is embracing the idea of a multiverse (with WandaVision, Dr. Strange 2) and with it things like Spider-Man jumping universes to Venom/Morbius or even Sony doing a Spider-verse film with the Raimi-verse/Webb-verse and Deadpool crossing over to the MCU. It sounds outlandish for sure, but Deadpool will signify their plans. If its an entire reboot, then nvrmd, but if they embrace the first 2 films, it does allow people to enjoy the fox films and a loose connection to the MCU lol",3

Hi Kevin  Just wanted to say that I ve always loved your work and i think it s insanely impressive what you and your studio pulled off with the infinity saga  Two questions  1.

"The effect was in the USA, and maybe other English-speaking countries, where it's ranked 7th for all the Marvel movies, and 38th overall.  Given that Infinity War was 2nd of all time, I would say that's a huge hit from what they were expecting. The Marvel movies are incredibly popular, and due to the endgame setup, people are getting more invested. You seem to be taking it personally though.",1

"But his origin story is substantially similar and his characterization isn't COMPLETELY different. There are some film makers that would have decided that Iron Man should be a genetically engineered cyborg. Plenty of things in the MCU aren't exactly the same as the comics, but unlike other film adaptations, the MCU has a decent track record of making changes that aren't entirely objectionable. That's a good thing. It's those differences that build hype and have us instituting spoiler bans.",3

I... don t see it,2

Absolutely top class response. So good to see people stick their necks out at for someone else's 'rehabilitation' instead of simply being sanctimonious. They're taking a risk with this. ,1

Not to me. It sounds like Cap is desperate and broken. Best line of the trailer for me IMO ,2

Anything! As long as he has a moment! Snapping counts as a moment but nothing beats Hulk smashing moments!",3

It's actually the trt... ,1
"Fricking Marvel Toms, always stealing Cap's shield...",2
 I thought the same thing.,1
Going again only for this and a few scenes.,1
...I don t think that was emphasized by the shield. Sure he is using it to protect Barton here but I think it was an improvement based on failing to protect himself.,1
"Did not add this to my other comment, but huge fan of the MCU and thank you for bringing it to life. I believe you may of changed the film industry's course with your success, and I look foward to other film studios trying the  marvel formula .

"The original comment that you made did not specify leading actors though, it was just talking about Marvels casting decisions- which I think Scarlett is plenty relevant in considering she is still a primary character and was also a pretty big name actor before the MCU started- so that was an original casting choice that ended up panning out, which has eventually lead to her own solo movie coming up here.",2

Add in that some people are actively racist, and that 50  of passed over applicants most likely grows.",1
IT'S NOT ANNIHILATION!  For some reason that makes me happy since people were *so* convinced Avengers 4 would be called Annihilation with no real evidence.  No time jump is definitely unexpected to say the least. But kind of makes sense in hindsight they'd want to show the direct aftermath of the Snap and Iron Man after facing inarguably the biggest trauma of his life.  Was hoping we'd see Captain Marvel but I guess considering her movie hasn't come out yet that was kind of wishful thinking. Lol,1
Isn't it a variation of the piece from the beginning of Infinity War?,1

"Hey Kevin, I wanted to do my part and say what a masterful job you ve done at creating a universe that so many of us connect with. It has to be so difficult with all these moving pieces.

Said the anonymous source. The disgusting nature of your lies is incomparable to the disgusting nature of your truth. You can't even walk this back because it's on a verified social media account.  It's baffling to me that Democrats think that pedophiles should be in charge of kid's movies. I'm sure that's normal for a Democrat.  I love how you're not even denying that you're a Democrat defending a pedophile. Remember this America. This is what Dems are. This is what they believe in. This is their nature. ,1

This time cast a kid-brother Human Torch, who would be younger than Spider-Man. x200B Let Spider-Man deal with a more obnoxious version of himself as he moves into a leadership role.",1
"I get that.  And I pretty much agree. But, now it's settled for the nitpickers. Unless someone want's to argue (with some merit) that deleted scenes shouldn't be considered canon.

So Steve did nothing wrong? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the movies, but I hope in the future that Avengers films are done by a director or directors that aren't so obviously fans of one character over another.

Does Marvel Studios have any plans for the Black Knight?,1
Hawkeye is just that cool dad of a friend/uncle who shows up to bail you outta jail and gives you real talk about what do you wanna do with your life. He doesn't care what you choose but he's at least gonna lay it out for you so you know where you're standing and your options,1

Every planet thanos visited prior to the snap was halved.  There's a lot of slaughtered people who just lost even more loved ones.,1
"You ve had a good sense for what was working and calibrated along the way.  The audience has universally embraced your finale.  Does what s happening with Game of thrones give you anxiety?

How involved are you personally when someone says something like,  We want Thor to be fat the entire movie. ",1
That's Jessica Jones ,1
100  it is low ratings that made Netflix want to cancel the shows.

War Machine has been given the short stick way too many times.",3

"Well, no. In Norse mythology, Loki isn't related to Odin, adopted or otherwise. Marvel sort of came up with that one, although MCU is even different, since Loki seems to be even younger than even his comic counterpart.  In the comics, Hela is supposed to be his daughter. Also, in the movies, we see flashbacks of Odin riding Sleipnir before Loki was ever born. Unless they're setting up some God of War time travel scenario where Loki's children are all instrumental in shaping his future self.",2

 First of all thanks for my childhood and teenage hood(I think that s the right word)   Anyway my  first question is If you could have the MCU crossover with any other franchise  Which would it be and why? Second is kinda embarrassing but..what does a president of a movie studio actually DO day to day? I imagine it s mostly paperwork right?,1

"Yeah. Honestly, Season 2 just retreads the whole  BuT ShE's A GuRL!  conflict which is kinda redundant after Season 1, and while the main plot itself isn't really bad it doesn't add a whole lot to the MCU (a *very* minor connection to AoS,) and it ends on a cliffhanger that will never be resolved.",1

"It's not even that. Disney would be taking something they want to be positive (their Black Widow movie) and associating it with negative things (Russian influence on the internet, Russian bots, Russian espionage, etc).  One of the biggest factors on the internet and social media is Russian interference. Im someone gets a random message on Twitter in Russian, that's not going to be a positive response by the user.  This is a cute idea in theory, but when you look at it further it's not gonna end well.",3

"If the quality of these Marvel series is anything close to the Mandalorian, I'd be very happy with the shorter run time.  It's probably the wrong attitude to have, but in my mind these Disney+ shows are like MCU DLC. I've already got the main game and I'm loving that, so I'm not terribly fussed when it comes to the DLC packs they're releasing.",3
"Ahhh yeah, I wasn't a huge fan of that moment either.  I guess the difference between that and Ragnarok for me, is that THAT wasn't a huge, character defining moment. Banner's sacrifice, and Asgard burning, absolutely were.  That doesn't make the moment you cite less annoying, but I felt like it at least didn't get in the way of the characters, you know? But that's just me.",1
"There's not a absolute metric that determines if a film is 'great' or not. It's totally subjective. You can't tell the guy his opinion on film quality is incorrect. If that dude says its great and you says its mediocre then neither one of you is right or wrong, you just disagree.",0

In the final film we got a much better version, who despite not looking grounded at all (it s a comic book film), was still able to pull off human emotions realistically. Along with this, TV shows such as Vikings, The Walking Dead, The Last Kingdom etc - publish trailers with partially complete CGI, and change it upon release to be more finished.",1

And anyway, they don't have any reason to do it, since *Captain Marvel* has been successful. ",1
"Whedon at least showed the team interacting, whereas the Russo's emphasis on plot led to what I call  colour scenes  (which serve no plot points and are just there to add to the characters) being almost totally absent.

Thanos might just go  the sun's getting real low .",3
"It s really just mediocre and it s cringey as hell that people aren t willing to admit that it getting nominated for best picture is a huge joke.

Like, sure the ultron project was misguided, we can give him that but like seriously, again with the drones? What happened to just doing regular hero stuff with the new generation?  Also, really stark, giving Parker glasses that can kill people at a moments notice? Could you just not?  Stark is really lucky that Parker is a great person who has a strong moral code.",3
"The only real failing was that it didn't use any of it's runtime to be that serious, which kind of left me wanting. Everything that is there is top-notch, but that just made what was missing more glaring.",3
"> similar to how Katy Perry revealed last year that she shaved her head so she didn t look like Katy Perry anymore, but rather Kathryn Elizabeth Hudson, her birth name I thought she cut her hair off because a bad dye job trying to go blonde torched her hair?",1

"That's ok, get it all out",3
Highest is  25. Really taking a chance here.,3
Agreed. Its not like that wasn't posted all over Reddit when the movie was coming out.  Sometimes... Sometimes I feel like it's people's first day on Reddit.  But this sword is BADASS,3
WAIT WHAT!?,1
HhHhHhhhhhhnnnnnnngggg.....,1
"Could Gunn argue that this issue was publicly  available and that a reasonable person in Disney s position would have or should have known about this prior to hiring and so the firing is not due to morality, but rather reaction to a public mob? ",1

Thor the latht lebowthki,1

For me it's the movie. Don't want any spoilers,1
also looks like Hulk in the Hulkbuster,1
"Hello Mr. Feige I was wondering that since the new Marvel shows coming to Disney+ will heavily impact the greater MCU, will the current Marvel shows, such as Agents of Shield, be integrated and more connected to the greater MCU in the future Congratulations on all your success and thank you for your time.",2
"Favorite part of the trailer, Cap is my favorite so I can t tell you how hyped I am.  Also sad because you have to realize people are going to die in this movie. Like lead characters. ",1
"Calm down lol.. I know we all love RDJ but Cruise has been doing great movies since the 80's ffs You think Cruise can't pull of an overconfident, snarky, flirty guy?? Go watch any of his early few movies... Cocktail, Days of Thunder, TG, MI etc etc As for stunts then one can argue Cruise's films rely on actual action happening rather than just using CGI for their scenes, I know which one I'd prefer",2
Lulz,1
"The movies don t all take place at the same time they premiered. Iron Man 2 and Thor happen during the same week, for instance.",2
I think it's a guy named Cable? ,1
I'm not who you think I am... Holy Molly  ,1
" I don't know, May! I don't know! There's got to be something here! This means something! This has to mean something! The world needs us! Hydra is out there! We cannot let them win!

After everything we've been through, that carries weight! Phil Coulson",3
I didn't realize the webs were indented like that. It looks so damn nice,2
"Exactly. As long as Disney refuses to make solo Hulk movie, we will never get one",1

I really wish Stan was old Cap,2
"Most fans IRL I know, myself included, really don't like the character. Primarily because of the actress. She's pretty cringe and kinda gives me anxiety over the future of the franchise, sorry to kill your erection dude...",1
"Casting the same actor as two different people in different movies set in the same universe doesn't make something non canon, that's an absurd argument. However I agree about AoS. I love AoS, but it pretty clearly doesn't mesh with Infinity War and Endgame no matter what Joseph Loeb says. Which is fine imo, they clearly weren't given the scripts and thus just had to ignore it. Not really a big deal, them lining up would have been nice, but I don't think it's necessary for the show to be enjoyable.",1
So why do we think their minds are blown by Scott showing up?,1
That seems like something Andy Dwyer would say. Lol,2

"Hi Kevin!!  First of all there is no way to put in words how happy we all are about what you did for the MCU. It's really incredible. With that in mind, how was the process? How did you start in 2008 with a movie that had dialogues that were improvised to creating a cinematic event that got fans really moved? Was there a plan back then? Where you already thinking about all these stories and the ending of the infinity saga back then?",1
He DOES NOT stick with his friends!! Did you see what he did to Rick Flair!,1
That will be number 2,0
"That mid credits scene appears to be very early on in Endgame since Cap still has his beard, and Widow still has her blonde hair.",3

Goddamnit Sebastian and I look like homeless brothers. (yes he's the hot one),1

"That s mommy's word, she coined it, it belongs to her.",2

Tony doesn't even have scraps or a cave yet. ,2
I know! I cry every damn time I see that intro. I've never been so engaged in the first ten minutes of a film. Amazing.,3
Technically they all did.  Tony just didn t tel them how to use it. It just changed around them with no thought or effort from anyone. Almost as if they didn t even know they were wearing Nanotech.,1
"I hope this does not come back to haunt them. Gunn has not had a social media presence for well over a week now, George Takei was still on social media during the time he had an accusation, said allegation proved false. Kevin Spacey allegations, he s not been heard of on social media in nearly a year. Im sharing an observation, not an indictment. ",1

Does it say anywhere if it's region A or region free? I'm receiving mine on tuesday in Denmark.,1
How much of marvel's current success is due to planning vs how much of it was luck? I guess I just wanted to know the extent of the planning that went into it.,1

The MCU is one of the most special franchises for me and so many other people as well, and that couldn t have been a reality without you. Keep doing awesome things!! My question is really simple compared to some of the others in this thread, but I m very curious as to which character in the MCU is your personal favourite?",2

Do we even know if war machine is returning?,1
Maybe a cameo as a fan-boy or a post credit scene of him drawing hearts around Spider Man's face in a magazine? Possibly the old gag of someone seeing him and thinking he's Spider Man on a subway?,1

WHAT IS THE FUCKING BUDGET FOR THIS FILM?!?!,1
Ray is the best. ,1
Idk I sort of feel like Rocket will stick around Thor.  They connected and he really has nowhere else to go.,1
The place they put him in Ragnarok was basically Kirby Space where it felt like a proper marriage between cosmic and fantasy.,2

Great news all around! I figure they would work it out but part of me was resigned to the idea that this was done for good based on the statements by both parties last few weeks. It would've felt like a major lost after making Spider-Man so much a part of MCU just to destroy it all. Good day indeed!,1
Sony did recently announce a movie about Madam Webb as well so that may very well be the intent,3
Who is in the picture?? I can't see anyone,1
Also avatar is probably gonna get rereleased and take back the spot.,2

Did you seriously just say hitherto undreamt of?,3
Happy they cut this scene but maybe if there was a scene like the last few seconds of this clip where it showed all the heroes around Tony just staring in disbelief or something would have been nice. That said there isn t much more there could have been done to improve Endgame,2

"So, what's next?",0
IDK I only remember them using her name,1
This is it. This is what my whole life is leading to. So hyped!,1
1. The female perspective: showing the story through the lens of a woman 2. I don t care about TV they don t count 3. Thor has a big personality. He wakes up and immediately starts talking and making jokes. Not a single female character could do that in the MCU 4. It s dumb that you  not the same universe  a comic fan who waited years for his favorite character to be properly introduced (like almost every other hero in the MCU is).,1
"Although she's not quite Rescue - Rescue with meant to have no weapons, it's for search and rescue only. That's why it can generate force fields, but even its repulsors don't generate heat can can't do much damage. So I shall call her Rescue But With Guns.",1
I think that's summarising it very well ,1
"The best part of Marvel trailers lately had been the misdirection.  Like the Hulk being shown in the Wakanda battle in Infinity War trailers, when the movie was totally different. They get us hyped, but they keep the plot secret. ",1
"I doubt that dude has licensing agreements set up for all the posters he makes, so it isn't like he can complain too much.",1
"Hey Kevin! First, I just want to say thank you for your role in crafting this beloved universe and all your efforts to connect and build relationships between the characters and fans.

With Thor, people get to experience his gains and losses with Thor himself. Witness him at his beginning, his lowest, his greatest and so forth. It's not the same with Captain Marvel and very well, will never be the same",0
"Marvel had a Captain Marvel since the 60s or 70s. Billy never had a series called Captain Marvel at DC. It was always the Power of Shazam or something. They changed his name because the New 52 reboot made a good transition point, and Johns wanted to push him with his own series, plus potential movies. Carol becoming Captain was the culmination of nearly a decade of character development.",1
"They saw how successful beards were with Cap and Thor, so...",3

Why don't you guys read the comics. I bet the majority of the ppl that saw the movie haven't read one of the comics in their entire life so I don't understand the fandom.,1
Hahaa that is awesome    ,0
Movie release date confirmed for April 26th (as seen on Marvel's Instagram).,2
"No shit. If you looked up  curmudgeon  in the dictionary, it would have his picture.",2
I think the best way would to do some sort of dimension hopping. Would also be how they bring in Deadpool. The best thing is it would allow Sony to still have there own universe is they want but Tom Holland can appear in MCU when the stories allow.,2
Yeah but they didn t have a talking rabbit,1

"The fact that he publicly dealt with this scandal and apologized half a decade ago should be relevant. How can he be hit with the same scandal twice lol It s really not a big deal. I ve said worse shit than that in jest. It s really just people giving a shit because of his political stance, which is stupid. The only reason this was brought up at all was because a conservative blog wanted to  take him down a peg.  It s pathetic and  sad!  ",1

The last sentence implies that Thor will need good special effects to make up for these no name actors playing the lead role.  It s clearly a dig.  And a dig that aged quite poorly. OP is right,1

It's allegedly going to be the first ever 3d movie that doesn't require glasses to be worn. If that's true it's going to make a ton,1

Marvel should pay you to do that. Incredible!,1
My favorite answer,1
AHAHAHAHA. this is fucking beautiful.,1
"I just assume that pym particles are known about somewhere else in the galaxy. With his double sword breaking the captain america shield, and returning to his hand like mjolnir, it seemed like they were emphasizing that the MCU heroes are only really impressive on Earth.",2
It really makes you appreciate the lesser Marvel Movies (looking at you Dark World and Iron Man 2) who also have script/director issued but at least have strong leads in Hemsworth/Downey. Unfortunately Brie wasn t able to elevate that godawful script,1
In the week leading up to the release of their mega blockbuster? I doubt it very much. Very much.,2
"I like this. In addition to that, I could see the professor Hulk getting messed up and then getting angrier and angrier, and therefore much stronger.  They could not only take him back to his glory days of smash, but also sort of carry on this  Banner as Hulk  persona, in a much more savage like nature than the professor.",1
"Hey Kev! First, just wanna say thank you. For it all. Question- What made you decide to pull Inhumans from the movie slate? Was it your decision to make it a show? Were they supposed to impact IW and Endgame? I feel like that was a huge aspect of the MCU that was tossed. If there are future plans for them I know you can t say what they are, but I m just curious as to what happened involving the past plans.",1

Whedon is not part of iw or avengers 4 other than any framework stuff he did back before since he infinity saga was him and feige idea,1

It's one of those movies that usually would remain in script form because it's just too good to survive the bureaucratic studio process with its soul intact?  Were these 2 films particularly satisfying to you in some way to see through to fruition?",1

Never been more hyped for one single scene,1
"Haven't saw the animated version of Batman vs Superman, I'll put that on my list of stuff to watch because I haven't saw a single one of the animated movies that I completely didn't like. Ugh, the live action movie though. I wanted to see Batman fight Superman, not Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne being as ordinary as their real identities are supposed to be, the whole point of a secret identity is it's how a story about a superhero starts and not the focus of the whole thing.",1
I'm holding out hope that they're cancelling all this stuff ... And suddenly the four heroes appear in Infinity War part 2 alongside the Avengers,1
"Not so much controversial as just weirdly unnecessary, but ok. ",3

I miss Wilson Fisk!  D'onofrio killed it in that role.,3
Thanks for wasting all of our fucking time.,1
I mean you start with Stan every one else basically has to at that point.,1
"No way. Personally I think blockbusters like Marvel and Star Wars put out are meant to be watched in a theater the first time. There s a sense of awe and wonderment in a movie theater that can t be replicated unless of course you re uber rich and have your own home theater at home. I like watching it at home after it s released on digital or blu-ray to find anything I missed the first go. Easter eggs, jokes I missed etc.",2

">!I mean, if a person is missing, where do you get footage of that person, other than an archive? :P I think he arrives very early in the movie. Makes sense in my head that Banner, Widow, Thor, and Cap hurry back to the Avengers HQ to assess the situation, and that's where Ant-man shows up.

Funny to think Marvel ended up doing dark and gritty better than DC. ,1
"> I thought remember Gunn said GotG3 would take place before IW, I hope not, if Guardians 3 takes place before Infinity War than the hole Thor and Guardians scene at the end of Endgame becomes useless.",1
I think it was also rereleased in theaters once or twice.,2
"I'm sure it's been a theory for a while but introducing skrulls (old lady who gets hit) in captain Marvel, show that they've been around for 20/30 years, and then finish the thanos story. Good way to set up a big arc and villains for the next phase.  I really, really hope we end up getting secret wars next",1

well he is already older than that since he was born in 1918 then lived to 2023 which is 105. he then jumped back and over to 1945 and lived past that timeline's 2023 which would place him around 210.,1
What's a character you want to bring to the MCU but you just can't see working right now?,1

the answers should be swapped,3
"Something tells me this is occurring early on in the movie, where she's still realizing that she is on her home planet. She still thinks she's surrounded by Skrull, and so this old lady makes some comment that makes Marvel think she's non-human. She's actually still an old lady, she goes to the hospital, and Marvel has to be on the run (hence the  Captain America  disguise with the hat and hoodie).",2

Thank you this helps explain it better cause last year I binged the whole show and then I tried watching the new season live and couldn t catch on.

As long as captain marvel doesn t save the day I m good. The story should focus on the original cast.

With Loki, his ending in the last Thor film (as far as I remember) basically left him missing in Asgard after using the eternal flame.

Thank Thor!,1
"True, though the timeline is a bit sketch at that point so its hard to say if they had already made the decision to go to Wakanda by the time Strange looks into the future.",1

"I wouldn't call Brie Larson Jesus, but yeah I guess she was pretty damn good as Captain Marvel, I'll give you that!",3

ok this is amazing,1
Stan Lee wouldn t have wanted this :(,2
"It s been said a number of times that the Loki show takes place throughout history. And the movie can be about Gamora without her physically being there the whole time.  I also don t see what s wrong with wanting/expecting dead characters to say dead. We ve already gotten many  deaths  that later were undone. There s gotta be some kind of stakes, especially for a movie like this",3
"Hi, Kevin. Thank you for doing this and more importantly, thank you for giving all of us something to love and be passionate about. I'm curious as to whether or not this whole 22 film (so far) saga, the infinity saga, wherein we've had the culmination of multiple storylines and MANY superheroes, was the grand scheme/plan from the beginning when you first did Iron Man?",1

Right you are!,3
Oh hell yes,1
How would you of changed Game of Thrones season 8?,1
Fantastic work by Charlie and the entire cast. Daredevil was my most favorite show in recent memory and it's unfortunate that it's over. At least it went out on a very high note. ,1

"Yeah they knew, Markus and Mcfeely (Creator credits on Agent Carter, Writers of Cap 1, 2   3, Avengers IW and Endgame) wrote the show and Louis D'Esposito (VP at Marvel Studios) and Joe Russo directed episodes.  That is the only series that we can definitely say Marvel Studios had a hand in developing and running.",2
"Hello Mr Feige, Are there any plans to do the Dark Avengers arc with Norman Osborne? Everyone keeps throwing around Dr. Doom as the next potential big bad but I think with Spidey being so integral to the MCU, introducing Norman Osborne as the next director of SHIELD and building him up as the next team up villain makes more sense. It would be amazing to see Spider-Man step up as the new Iron Man and take down Norman and the Dark Avengers with the Avengers help.",1
"When one of the few things that can make it more epic is a flying aircraft carrier, you know you've gone super-epic.",2

May the thor be thor four,1
"What are YOU talking about...? I said was that I'd like to see someone else besides Doom as the Black Panther 2 villain, maybe Kraven the Hunter.

Whoever it takes.,2
Though the New York sanctum had a different master guarding it by the time of Dr. Strange accident and journey. She must have relinquished that position. Same with putting the eye of agamotto in the library for Strange to find as was forseen,1

"I mean, it was kind of sort of implied that he might be someone that has a reason go be there, but it certainly wasnt clear",1

Do you feel like the future films could ever top Endgame?,1
How is this making fun of a tragedy anyway? Can't you just imagine Ant-Man stopping the Titanic before it's too late?  You lack imagination. ,1
They make logical movies. That's because they're well accepted everywhere. And u cant make a character movie without including the only known friends of that character. Also with Hawkeye series falling in fall 2021. If they're planning BW to Kickstart(or just hint it)the new saga that marvel plans. They should include everybody's favourite birdie in it.,0

"The new deal was 50/50, which is in my opinion VERY reasonable considering all marvel had before was 5  of the overall gross and merchandise sales. Sony is legit being greedy",1
"Still the wrong hand. The shot on the photo is not the one that eventually ended in the movie, obviously. At one point, they chose to use the other hand.",3

You gotta talk to the Lady about that.,1

"No, we are existing in the timestream, not traveling in it.  Its a differentiation between  time  as an abstract, and  time  as an object.",2

"Can you imagine that she was actually pregnant, enough to feel something inside her, but not necessarily be visibly pregnant, and the snap happens.

I watched up until the end of season 4 and it does feel an improvement from s1. That said it is far from high art and regularly dips into to Team Knightrider territory. Its annoyingly rubbish and I still don't know why I watched as far as I did (probably because people raved it was so good).,1
"Not even joking, I was so suicidal at one point. But I really wanted to see the Captain America movie. It was the only thing that kept me going.",2

"So it's a well put together video, but I feel like it highlights what is wrong with cinematic fight scenes in this day and age. They cut the shot as soon as contact is supposed to be made to make it easier to shoot and cgi. And it just makes fight scenes confusing and unfulfilling imo",1
I always see Robert Downey Jr before MCU as himself in Less Than Zero. I am happy to see how he has evolved since the start of MCU.,3

"It's heartwarming to hear that RDJ is being a great coworker and supportive mentor to other actors, because RDJ himself got a LOT of help from other people when he was at rock bottom and needed second chances, and paying that grace forward like John did is the best way to pay it back. ",3

Where can I get some Captain Marvel swag?,1
"i'd say directors are artists. imagine artists saying that other people art is trash. that's pretty much what they are doing, and while they are entitled to their opinion, it's so hypocritical that an artist is criticizing another artist when art is supposed to be personal and individual. while it may not appeal to you, it makes many others feel a joy and emotion and that's what should really matter. not whether a film is good or bad or  despicable  or  not cinema. ",2
"> Scarlet Witch I'm not against it but wouldn't Vision have to die (again) in order for that to happen? I mean, unless they break up at the end of WandaVision, which is possible I guess.",1
Felt that way somewhere around Phase 2. I realized it's unrealistic for me to keep this hyped about this stuff. Maintained opening night attendence through phase 3 but Endgame felt like a  one last ride before retirement  point. I just hoped it would deliver and boy did it ever.,1
"Dr. Strange isn't exactly a big cosmic player. He's huge with multidimensional beings and threats from other realms. Asgard is considered a realm, not a planet. Probably closer to a pocket dimension, maybe? I think it'd be more accurate to call Thor a being from another realm vs an alien or cosmic being like Thanos.",1
Or before his arrest when he was apparently a very successful burglar.,3
Specifically playing Chardee Macdennis,1
I wish he is lying so that in reality he isn t dying of a terminal illness and he won t have to leave his life unfinished :( Unfortunately he most likely isn t lying ,0
Captain America shedding tears  ,1
We knew about that before that fake leak came out.,1
Sony handles the marketing. If you read the book The Big Picture it lays out the deal that two companies have. If you go to marvel studios official social media pages there s no hint of Far From Home anywhere. I have a feeling Sony started marketing it against marvel studios wishes. Can t imagine Feige is too pumped that they pseudo-spoiled Endgame. ,2
Spoiler Alert :(,0
why is that though? The number of DC movies I see in a year does not reduce the number of Marvel. I also think that if all super hero movies are  good  I will be seeing them on a more regular basis and therefore less likely to skip a marvel movie. ,1
God damn it that's probably the line.,3
"Troll grade: F- Needs more effort, possibly a reference to the Last Jedi.",1
"But who do I blame, the actor or the director, for Dumbledore getting all angry and yell-y, and seemingly out-of-sorts all the time in the movies? I want to know, since that, to me, is the worst mistake of those movies (which I otherwise love dearly).",1
"I had no idea what I just watched, but it was amazing. Good job OP! Seems to me there's also some sort of colour correction being done, the pictures seem a lot more vivid than usual.",1
"Hi Kevin! Thank you so much for all you have done for the MCU- everyone here really appreciates your work! The MCU is a marvel (pun intended) I was wondering: 1) Which was your favourite comic character arc, and 2) As the MCU goes forward and become bigger, it might be harder for someone who hasn t followed the MCU much. Do you feel that this might be a problem from Phase 4 onwards?  Thank you so much!",1
I met him (sorta) at DragonCom where he complimented my Natasha Romanoff cosplay. It really made my day honestly. He's really awesome!,1
And then they ruined him,1
"Because Netflix likely owns the rights to this version of Daredevil. It's like what happened with the Spectacular Spider-Man series once Disney brought it, Sony still has the rights to THAT version of animated Spider-man.",1
Didn't one of the writers say that Baron Mordo would become a Loki type character?,1
This. This right here. ,2
we live in a galaxy,3
"Yeah, there's no absolute freedom at Marvel  that'd be a disaster. The MCU has been successful because Feige provides the guiding hand. They do let directors add their own flavor, but it has to fit within the character's and the overall arc. WB/DC tried to thump their chest about all the  freedom  they gave directors, without a clear Feige type manning the ship... see how that turned out.",3
How do you know when a character's story is over? Do you collaborate with the actors on that stuff?,1

And the fact that the avengers will freakin LOSE ALL OF THESE FIGHTS TO SET UP FOR THE SECOND MOVIE,1
"If you were in Gunn's shoes, would you take a job under such odious circumstances? Losing his position at Marvel Studios was bad enough. He would be insane to return in such an undignified way. It's not like Marvel Studios is his only option. James Gunn will find far better opportunities elsewhere than what you're describing.",1
"Hi Kevin,   First off thank you so much for bringing this marvel universe to the big screen. I ve grown up with these characters and I love watching their stories unfold.  So my questions are: Are there any plans to develop Moon Knight into the universe? Or is the plate to full now that X-men, FF, eternals, and Shang chi are coming?  What was the best moment you have had making these movies?",1
"Please grow up. Please, please please grow up. Calling everyone you don't like a nazi is stupid, immature, and just massively pathetic. It makes you look weak like you can't actually argue with or engage with any one who disagrees with you so you just go straight to the n word as a quick escape route. Grow up I'm saying this not for my sake but for yours. Do yourself a favor and use your big boy words. ",0
I think you just saw it.,0

"He's the boss, he can answer whatever he wants",1
"What's up with the blank poster 2nd row, 2nd from right?",1
I think it s a scenario where cap is just really clutch. Also he has a massive shield aimed at massive/slower targets. Hawkeye hit a flying bike dude behind his back like wtf,1
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel!,3
People assume he wants to be Spider-Man for the next 10 years. Maybe he d rather not he tied to that character his whole career.,1
You mean 19?,2
"Look if its set in another universe then it's not the MCU. The MCU is just one universe- if the majority of it is not in th MCU then its not canon. Its very simple to understand., in my opinion.",0

"I think he does. Tony's always been trying to be the hero, even though he acknowledges that he is flawed. Like he said to Peter in Homecoming when Peter said he wanted to be like Tony,  I wanted you to be better than me . Like how Cap left that heartfelt voicemail at the end of Civil War, I think we'll get a voicemail to Cap from Tony at the end of IW that will play over the epilogue with after his death (or apparent death) with the message to  Avenge  him.",1
Considering the dude leading the crusade is an ACTUAL RAPIST (Mike Cernovich) I know who I m rooting for. ,2
The detail is so cool.  Cumberbatch keeps the eye of Agamatto in the arc reactor and his repulsor Ray's have energy signatures resembling the Chrono dials of the time Stone. Stark has ditched the robes of Kar mataj for something a bit sleeker with a spot for his arc reactor to shine through,1
Would anyone left actually care about Nebula? The only remaining guardian is Rocket. Most of the avengers have never encountered her.,1
"Damn, I really like that kid. He's got mojo.",1
"During Yondu's funeral, Drax makes a joke about Mantis being ugly. That's the thing though, it doesn't kill the mood like Korg does in Ragnarok. It's just a throwaway gag about something unrelated to the serious moment as opposed to something that completely makes light of what just happened. Letting serious moments breathe doesn't mean refraining from jokes entirely, it just means that the characters should treat the situation with the gravity it requires.",2
He's building a replicator so he doesn't starve or dehydrate.,3

It will be on Netflix before the end of the year,2
"I get LC and IF,  but man. Imagine having a show with solid fan base and solid performance and still cancelling it. Unless Disney is moving it to their streaming service, they re stupid and not taking advantage of the gold in front of their face. If the Disney streaming service can bring in the Disney movies for kids, and start producing grittier stuff like this. Man, Netflix will shrivel.  Get your shit together Disney, stop making it hard for me to give you my money. ",1
Oh damn how did I miss that lol,1
I'm so hard right now.,1
Gotta thank his boy Favreau lol,3

Next to most signatures is the name of that actor's character. These are a lot easier to read.,2
"They could say that Venom is from a timeline/universe without a Spiderman, so he never developed an obsession against him, and Eddie Brock, while still a jackass, is on the side of justice. Spidey and that Venom could join forces to fight yet another version of Venom. It could be a bit too similar to that Batman's darkmetal series and related, but eh , if its cool it could work.",1

See how well nuance works in the real world?,1
I think she deserves a chance under a fantastic director in an MCU that has matured to the point that it has. Watch Black Swan and try to think of the similarities between fight and dance choreography. Shes tiny but has proved she can commit her body to the right script and CG can make her as big as a house if they want. Nat 4 prez.,1

"I would counter that Ruffalo (and the writers, of course) turned one of the few characters with depth beyond  I quip and have superpowers  into a bigger piece of comic relief than the talking raccoon that steals prosthetics. There are no stakes to Ruffalo's Hulk, and his Banner comes off as whiny and confused rather than tired, cautious and fearful.  Norton's Hulk was a curse, and he knew it. Ruffalo's Hulk sells toys and is irrelevant.",1
"They did have Vicky whatsherface from Ironman 1 and 2, as a news anchor on a few youtube clips. Thats worked well but on youtube not many saw it (related to age of ultron if i recall)",1
"Kevin, How did the creative team behind Spiderman Homecoming come to the  8 years later  decision? Is this a simple hiccup that you wish was thought out more? The amount of attention to detail is unprecedented in these films and I greatly appreciate the effort you put in.",1
"Hey Kevin, Big fan of the MCU. I have a question about Infinity Wars.  x200B During the Guardians attempt to collect the Reality Stone from the Collector on Knowhere, a brief shot is seen of a freshly blown blue Tobias Funke in a Collector's cage. Was that really Tobias Funke in the cage and Thanos was simply recreating an exact replica of the Collector's museum? OR was Thanos just a fan of  Arrested Development  and used the Reality Stone to pay homage to his favorite show?",1
"Could be off on this, and correct me if I'm wrong, but at 0:25, that hangar kinda looks like the airfield in Captain Marvel. Maybe she pops up and helps them renovate?",1
"That s what mine said. I wanted to send it to the store since I didn t trust the movies to sit in my apartment entrance, but it said if I shipped it to my home I d have gotten them the 19th. So makes me wonder if they would have secured it sooner if it went to me directly.  Kind of annoyed and hope it does still show up.",1

"Hello Mr Feige! I would just like to thank you for your service in bringing the MCU to where it is now. I am curious.

Are you planning on bring Kingpin to big screen?,1
She just looks like an incredibly regular person *withanincrediblerack. That does incredibly regular things. Like get passed out drunk on vacation while trying to walk a  mile home from the bar.,1

To each his own but I only finished Season 3 because I'm invested in the series. Had I known it'd be canceled I would have stopped after episode 3. I know you disagree but I thought DD S3 was garbage. DD S1 was great. DD S2 was good. The Punisher S1 was amazing. Nothing else is even worth mentioning from Marvel Netflix. Iron Fist was maybe the worst show I've ever forced myself to watch. Jessica Jones not far behind. ,1

They're probably reading through these   very threads right now,1

RIP Stan Lee... :(,1
I think so too. The man lived as long and full a life as anyone could ever hope for. To inspire billions of people like his works have is a task few others have ever done. To live with his loving wife for so long as well is a mark of a truly blessed life. The man will have an undying legacy for decades to come.

Its okay for family to be involved, or to be missing or to be alive and living in a crisis area. Its not okay for mom to show up saying  oh darling a man in black killed your dad in your absence .

They're proving more and more that they've learned to break out of their box. I'm officially hype",1
I loved that scene bc it worked with the film. It wasn't forced nor did it go against the grain of the film in some way.  It was a little too obvious that they'd all be there at that exact time but I took like they were supporting each other.  It was ridiculous or against common sense that it could happen that way.,1

The only way you fire Feige at this point in the game is if you want your fans in open revolt. You think the DCFU or SW has problems right now? Those situations would pale in comparison.

"That was also true in the 70's where blockbusters still existed, and still got the biggest budgets.",2
That is the blunt side of the axe.,1
Wouldn t that mean Strange had similar conversations with everyone else?,1

The run time on this movie is just over two and a half hours and I would be surprised if the second part is much shorter, so when it s all over, that s going to be about five hours which should be enough time (though based on this trailer I could easily sit through another 10-15hrs worth..).

"That's pretty impressive, he's got superhuman strength and heightened senses. Not many beings are able to best him in combat. Congratulations. ",2
I mean just in the initial fight between the four of them in Endgame. His suit wouldn t have just been wrecked by Thanos  sword quickly he would either need the Iron Protocol (from Iron Man 3) or just fought Thanos from a distance.,3

From a narrative standpoint the answer is based on the futures that Doctor Strange saw and that only one would work. So ostensibly if Tony didn t act in that moment as Strange gave him the signal something would have gone wrong. I m sure there are plenty of other reason why the writers chose to go this route but that s the answer that was given inside the narrative at least.,1

"Money. In simple terms, Sony and Disney split the earnings from the movies 95/5, but Disney got to keep all the revenue from the merchandise, so they both got to keep around the same amount of money. Now, Disney wants to have it as 50/50 instead, and Sony would earn much much less with that.",2

Hmm A Night Through the Spiderverse,1
Literally no chance of that. Iger said they want to have so kids can be left alone with it without any risk of seeing age inappropriate content. There's not going to be anything R on the entire thing.,1

"I am looking forward to seeing this but I am also a bit worried that it may be too similar to other Avenger films, though I understand this is the next installment and everything has been building up to the Infinity Wars, but the films dealing with the individual characters - to me - have a lot more personality, while the Avenger films feel a bit too close to one another in style. Anyone else find that?  ",1
Didn't know. Other sites reporting on their articles claim that they have gotten things right in the past.,0
"Also, he did Zathura which had a robot in it and he got experience with some of the technology. There s a cool part about it in his interview with Robert Rodriguez on The Director s Chair if you re interested!",2
That was actually a great way to make the sheer number of Avengers more manageable on-screen. Split them up in the previous movie.,2
That's just how Gen X operates.  You can see the same type of stuff with say Matt Damon.  Very dispassionate and calculated.  It's because they're angry all that time.,2
Why are they stranded? The Milano is there!,2
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN. IT IS ABOUT TO LEAVE THE STATION!,1
"Sony kind of put themselves into a difficult position. They let the MCU play too big of a role in the Spider-Man movies, so now if they try to pull him out they'd leave a big awkward void in their stories where they'd have to pretend SHIELD and the Avengers don't exist.",3
What is the guardians of the galaxy vol.1 Easter egg that has been missing?,1
"Initially, Disney said Disney+ isn't coming to India and Hotstar will get all the content. Now they are saying that Disney+ will be here by next year. I think they would want every Hulu licensing to pan out as per their original deal, and fold it in 2021-22. It's easier to keep an R-rated filter in settings, honestly. Edit: Fold it in in 2024.",1
"Slightly off fandom but if you look at the unsullied in GOT, they certainly still have everything down there.",1

After all, he seeks a utopia, right? ",1

Hyped ,1
Antman isn't in the trailer. Or if he is he is too small.,2
They seem like a warrior culture. Probably told the refugees time to start lessening how to fight. After fishing of course.,1
Yes. The marvel directors are auteurs that control every aspect of their film and make artistic choices with no restrictions.  I wonder why Wright left? I wonder why when Disney approaches guys like Fincher they run for the hills? I wonder why these Titans of cinema (Scorsese and Coppola) are dismissing these movies as heartless commercials designed for China?  It's j-just ur opinion man ,1
I think you and I will be friends. ,1
"First time i watched endgame, I very much expected Tonu to wake up and ask anyone if they wanted shawarma",1

Good shit.,3
I would have really dorked out and asked her to sing  Black Sheep (url) for me so I could die happy.,1
This is amazing. They corrected their mistake!,1
"I agree 100 . I wasn't satisfied with his arc in endgame. We didn't see his transformation to Prof. Hulk. How did he work things out between banner and hulk? I also wanted to see him rage out one last time, like in age of ultron vs iron man scene",2

Yeah it sucked but I ve grown more fond of that. I wish more movies sucked you in and had major plot twists,2

Blasphemy,1

"don't forget Xandar, he killed half of them like a week earlier as well.",3
"I know this is probably been asked already, but as a huge fan of the character, and the few hints given behind the scenes and in the movies themselves... How soon can we expect Namor to show up in a film?",1
"Don't dispute that he actually said it, attack the source. Donald Trump bragged about walking into dressing rooms that had naked minors.  He was relating actual events in his life. James Gun was making stupid jokes to be edgy. I'm sorry you can't see the difference.  One is stupid and got the guy fired, one is reprehensible and has had no consequences.",2
"Hi Kevin, one thing that I've been dying to rewatch Endgame to check is that: What happened to Mjolnir in the ending? Cap took it with him on his journey to the past, but at least from what I could see, he didn't bring it back with him. Did I just miss that? And if not, what did Cap do with it?!",1
A few billion? That s nothing compared to the revenue of additional films plus streaming/blu ray/ancilaries,3
"Huh, she has memory issues just like the original run of Ms. Marvel, neat. Though it's very different from how that went originally, where she was basically a werehero.

"RIP Stanley Martin Lieber, thank you for sharing your imagination and influencing my life.",1

Eh I guess I'll go see it. ,0

Nope  ,1
Wasn t it something about guns being too loud?,1
"Agree completely, punisher was a great addition to daredevil, took the series from pretty cool to downright dope in my view. I think each season just got progressively better",2

War machine might change since he saved him from drowning,2
"Hey Kevin! Thank you so much for making all of this happen, your work (and everyone underneath you) is absolutely amazing!    If you had to pick another franchise or series to go as big as the MCU, preferably one more unknown right now, what would you pick? Thank you so much for your time.",1

What? No,1
If you watch his  Nuff Said  bumper sticker in the Endgame scene there s a psychedelic mushroom image right in the middle of it,1
Thor was comedic relife and fath dhamed? What movie did you watch? In 3 hours they were 3 fat jokes. And since when was Hulk a fumbling weak idiot? He is one of the few beings who survived a snap budd.y did you miss tha detail?,2

 How? (url),1
"IW was Thanos', Tony's, Thor's, and Gamora's movie. I believe Endgame will be Cap's, Clint's, and Nebula's.",2
No it was either Chyler Leigh or Jaime Pressly . Not sure which one you are talking about. A lot of faces look the same to me.,1

Agent Hill wasn't in the battle. She was present at  The Wedding ,3
"I have to ask, did you ever think this crazy MCU experiment would work and become as literally world changing as it has? I can't believe it happened.  And when did you know you had something special where you looked back and said: Wow, this is a thing.",1

"Even worse, she was talking about professional critics and film media, and how women journalists reported they didn t get as many privileges when it came to access and such. It had nothing to do with general audiences.  ",3

I read everything in one. Being English and all,1
Oh I'm aware. I just think he'd have done a solid job. Gunn directing was always what should have happened. Gunn should've never been fired for jokes he made ten years ago to begin with. ,3
Remember when James Cameron said people would get tired of comic book movies? LOL,1
Ouch. My heart....,2
> based almost strictly on how remarkable its CGI was It certainly wasn't due to its incredibly unoriginal story.,1
What s your tv? Would love to know!,1
Yet another piece of concept art that is way more awesome than anything that happened in the actual film. What happened here...did they run out of budget?  The art department was making a way better movie than Endgame turned out to be.,0
He's not traditionally handsome enough.,0
Anyone seen Antman yet?,2
Still holding onto a joke you made 3 months ago and saying that if anyone makes anything similar they are stealing. ,1
It s Kree Larson ,1
Wtf. I clicked this sure it was trolling...,2
Imagine if there were no remakes and they actually continued the story,1
"Her investigation abilities might also make her S.H.I.E.L.D. agent material (she does becomes a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in a *What If ?* comic, incidentally). Captain America: Winter Soldier with Jessica would be... interesting.",1
"The characters say that's not how it works, but who even knows anymore. There are so many questions.",1
"Uh, he's from space, he came to steal a necklace from a genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.",1
Yep.  Fans have been asking for a Hulk vs. Hulk Buster fight in the movies and they got a AAA version.   The scene could have been an hour long and I would have been happy.,1
Who said  not us? It didn't sound like Cap,0
Thank you Kevin Feige.,1
THEY CANCELLED DAREDEVIL? WHAT,1
He has to do it and video record himself. ,3
We don t do that here,3
They keep making merchandising money with or without a Sony deal. They'll make that money from Sony's Spider-Man films too,2
December 2nd,1
He had Anne Sullivan's great granddaughter with him.,1
I m fine with this as long as none of y all bring up grab em by the pussy ever again. ,0
"New guy likely delivered a script with the same quality as Star wars  Episode 8, that was enough to bring back the old team . Good sense.  ",0
I would love too see a version of infinity war where everything is the same except Thanos doesn't have CGI,3
"you're just bitching because,  Brie Larson hates white males.  She said that more diversity for movie critics would be a nice thing. And it would. Everyone can agree. But instead you triggered ass neckbeards try to ruin it for other people.",3
"Those aren't cliffhangers, they're loose ends and dangling plotlines. The main plots of the seasons were concluded. Less so for for LC and IF, but definitely for JJ, Punisher and DD.",1

"Hey Kevin, ELI5: How profitable is Avengers Endgame?",1
"Hi Kevin, If Deadpool becomes part of the MCU, will his language be more family friendly?",1
Strange? With Thanos? What?,1
Downey was pretty much done with the role and I doubt they would recast him. They may have passed the mantle on to someone else though.,3
As President what would you like to see happen in the future MCU? I personally would love to see an X-Men crossover or a Deadpool crossover with Spiderman,1
Then how will you go watch Infinity War,1
"Yeah, you're not making any sense and no actual point.  >Emotionally, it's very draining.  Wut?",1
"He did see it early thanks to disney. This is a good story about a passionate man living his last dream, i can assure you that you are not the only one crying...",1
I'm OOTL here what happened?,1
Yet another reason to rewatch,1
Ohh id bow. I'd bow for sure. ,0
My OCD is screaming that some are looking left whilst others are looking right ,1
Do we think there will be another trailer during the game? Maybe after halftime or toward the end? ,1
Walking through Cerulean cave will be much easier now.,1

Why tf would Rhodey be anywhere near Cap after what he did to Tony?,0
"Hold on a sec, did no one notice the most important part? Samuel L. Jackson with a short afro! ",1
Avengers vs X Men.,2
I agree. It looks frozen in time.,1
Is there more of this kind of concept art? Would love to see what else could have been!  There has to be a treasure trove of this stuff at Marvel Studios. They should release it if they haven t yet,1

Fantastic 4 please,1
"Depending on how they do it, it could be that Spiderman will get lost in a different dimension, effectively ending his time in the MCU (until/unless they want to bring him back) and allowing him to be in the Sony universe without connecting the Sony Universe to the MCU (beyond it being part of a multiverse)",3
It was so wise of them to use Clint as the motivator though. That archer does not get his due.,2
I don't think anyone can just decide to exist again after being erased from existence by stones of infinite power...,3
I hope you enjoy it!,1
After credits. Infinity War takes place 4 years after the first Avengers I believe ,1
So is Strange gonna get shit every time he tells someone his name? Is this gonna be a reoccurring joke cuz I m so down for it. ,1
Compartmentalize that shit!,3
At least it isn't Annihilation. ,3
 Dead   How many will be back by the end of this movie?,1
I love both Ant-Man movies for the same reason. I like that they re small scale (heh) and family dramadies at their heart. They re fun and light and I can enjoy them with my little kids. I get that they re not super true to the comic characters but I m always surprised by how much this sub seems to dislike them. I rewatch them all the time bc they re like my go-to feel good movies. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily are both so charming I d watch them paint walls.,3
He is a portait of Alex Jones. At least in this one.,1
Looks like War Machine? ,3
"The only* I wasn t expecting much, but still wish we would get more than just cute little non answers.",2
"Stan Lee is just The One-Above-All, why else would he be in all the Marvel movies?",1
"Happy BUT Im getting this feeling that it's likely they might not renew after that. These movies might be the transition of Spider-Man towards Sony only eventually. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm still hurt lol Edit: the more I read, the more optimistic I'm getting. Abort  Abort",1
They just showed up and killed the sanctum's master before they engaged Strange.  https://youtu.be/Hw5-tHp4eb4 Best clip I could find. Edit: also it seems like an automatic tactical disadvantage to have just one dude against an innumerable amount of enemies.,1
"Umm his super strength is not high compared to thanos, Thor or hulk",1
"Wow, what an eye-catching experience. Big thumbs up on your edits!",1
That's awesome. Man I wish I had a 3d printer,1
Thanks! I actually like Agent 13 a lot so this news makes me happy.,1
"I like the *Milano*, don't get me wrong, but the *Benatar* is just a little bit cooler, IMO.",2
"Yes and this scene actually explains that she left, instead of me just watching the movie and wondering  wtf happened with gamora2 she ded or wut ",1
Holding up the infinity gauntlet WHILE IT HAS 2 INFINITY STONES IN IT AND ON THANOS'S HAND! Captain America is gonna be Captain Amazingly fucking AWESOME Just need Will Smith to come in and say  Welcome to Earth ,1
"So glad I saw this without the name reveal in the title. Scrolling through Facebook now, everybody has the name in the post.",1
"I imagine Natalie Rushman is one of her covers that get used when needed. At the end of winter soldier, she said she's blown through all her covers, so she needs time to figure out who she is. So yes, as Natalie Rushman, she had a few photoshoots and modelling in Tokyo to build a credible cover story, then put it on ice.",1
"I mean, more than half of these 32 characters aren't technically Avengers. Ant-Man and Wasp aren't. Black Panther, Okoye and Shuri aren't. Valkyrie isn't. Loki isn't. The Guardians aren't. Happy and Wong aren't. Dr. Strange isn't. A better way to look at it is that these are the central characters that are leading the narrative. Plus Pepper is probably going to end up becoming Rescue in this movie so at least from that perspective she'll be somewhat involved in the action.",1
The fact they left Loki out of the trailer is worse news than finding out the Patriots won another super bowl ,1
Lol okay Boomer.,1
"When does it get good? I've tried watching it three times now, and I always give up a few episodes in just because they've had 15 minutes of content in three and a half hours of show",0

I think he's referring to attacks from the other planes or realms. Not literal aliens.,1
"Yes, it is Disney who asked for more money, but from my understanding it wasn t as ridiculous as the initial 50/50 we were hearing about, I believe reports have now said it was around 70/30, but Sony didn t want to give up more than 25 ",3
"Actually it does mean something. It means the producers intended for Gamora to survive the snap, and most likely still do for GOTG3",1

"House of M is the definitive Scarlet Witch series. Also there's a whole thing before that iirc where she settles down with Vision, there's a good chance that'll be the basis for the Disney+ show that they're making. Adam Warlock is a big part of the Infinity Gauntlet story in the comics. He's on the power level that he shows up in a lot of big universe defining stories, but he's too powerful to be used on his own much.",1

'Robo-boning' hahahaha. Best term I've read all day ,1
"Idk it would be hard to make someone look that jacked with just a suit. Well, and look realistic anyway. He appears quite buff. Maybe the cape is throwing us off.",3

Looks epic so fucking awesome!!!! I only wish Fury and Hill were in it lame. ,0
"If you could add an additional movie anywhere in the last 11 years of the franchise, what would it be and where would it be placed?",1

Honestly its the only job I can see myself doing but now I know it's very tough and thankless at times since majority of it is taking care of issues no one will know about.,1
Hero series? All I see are villains? Where's Thanos?,0

don Cheadles head look so tiny compared to the warmachine armor. i know he's supposed to be a tank but that's too oversized,1
No consequences? Asgard and his hammer were destroyed...,1
Literally nothing in the film suggests she's magic. If telekinesis and energy blasts make someone magic... sure. But nah,1

I did!,1
Damn Cap is pissed asf and i don't disagree with him.,1
"Honest question, could this possibly be the firs R rated MCU film? I don t know why this gives me that vibe but it does.",2
The films are getting more unique each phase imo. I wouldn't worry.,3
She could get this work. No doubt,1
Don t cut yourself on all that edge retard. ,2
Definitely not immediately but I can see her becoming the Panther later in the franchise or in a What If episode. I am curious if she would want to become the Panther though.,1
Now *that's* a war machine story.,3

"Why the MCU films are that bad individually? I think you can do it better, I hope you try harder and take it seriously for the next film and ignore the money. Go for good writing of plot and characters and for a more mature audience, like the Black Knight. I hope you can do it",1
"When FRIDAY was introduced, I initially thought she was voiced by Karen Gillan... the actress who plays Nebula....",3

"Also, credit to those who support others, but ultimately that person has to step up or they will fail even with the best support. ",1
They start their tweets with 'we don't support the jokes Gunn made' or something to that effect. I'd imagine the conspiracy theories mentioned are those actually calling Gunn a pedophile etc. ,2
"Hi Kevin! At what point in the process did y all decide that an Infinity War type movie was going to happen? Also, after it was decided, was it always going to be roughly where it is in the timeline or was there a time where it could have been in phase 2 or even later like phase 4?",1
You're talking about winter soldier and the hydra arc in shield.,2
"Whatever you say, Frenches(Mustard)OP.",0
But we saw him holding someone's hand in first trailer right?,2
Also when it was time to fight in that suit I don t think he could ve pulled it off,3
It really stands out.  Mine is my name in basically readable letters. It feels inadequate next to these ones... ,3
No. That s fucking stupid.,1
"I use Photoshop multiple times a day and didn't even know it went down to 0! Logically having anything lower than 1 doesn't make much sense to me, surely you want at least a tiny little bit of quality? ",3

Yep!!! Not really a spoiler as it was pretty much a guarantee that he would come back to Earth with Nebula in tow. ,3

Pretty sure Tony is called Iron Man a good bit,1

" I m sorry, little one.  (url) ",1
"With Feige, who is as professional as they come, you have to look at what he doesn't say more than what he does say. He never commented that he agreed with the decision. When speaking about Gunn he only said positive things. I mean, Gunn was practically hand picked by Feige to develop a large portion of the MCU. There should be no doubt he had Jame's back.",3
The original was him being sent there and musing about How Adam Warlock bested him again. They changed it to him retiring there ,1

Would the download on Disney plus be the same quality as a blu ray?,1
"Yep, Dark knight was great. How was Superman? Oh yea... Oh how was Batman Vs Superman? Oh yea.... How about Suicide Squad.... lol... Wonder Woman was good, then Justice League... Oh yea... lmfao. Congrats on hitting par on a batman triliogy 5 years ago, but I don't think those sales are helping anymore. Marvel built a franchise out of its movies with Disney, DC is doing jack shit. ",1
"That s more of a  why they didn t  and I posted more a  why they couldn t even if they wanted to.  It s a little easier to understand when explained that way. And yeah Quills plan was solid, I mean we literally see that it worked perfectly. ",1
I would totally agree with the sentiment of this letter if it wasn t for the copious amount of pedophile jokes. Makes me wonder what s happening there.,3
"Carol, it's what we call her.",1
You can still see his face with his helmet on though,1
"I m sort of a fan of the idea that Thanos hasn t done really anything antagonistic at all since the snap. Obviously our heroes need to stop him, and reverse what s been done, but I don t think he needs to pursue them. He did what he set out to do, and I think him farming or just living his life would be a nice touch. The Avengers living up to their name and saving the day by being offensive first would be more interesting to me.",1
"Are you kidding? Nothing but hype surrounded A4 for a long while now, especially in this sub. That's no indication of the trailers quality at all. I mean, the trailer was good, but the reactions here were always gonna be the same regardless what the trailer was. To say nothing how it doesnt come close to ultrons trailer.",1
we get it. you vape,1
I guess they did ended up killing Spider-Man  after all,1
*why is everybody always pickin on me*,1
And biological warfare,1
Everything is character driven now.  That's the best kind of story telling.,1
So when Wolverine turns up in the last panel of The Incredible Hulk  180 that wasn't his first appearance? Because that's what you're saying about MCU Warlock right now.,0
Get this man away from MCU . I dont want fucking Deadpool in MCU . NOOOO DONT WANT IT .,0
"I'm hopeful those cut scenes aren't representative of the gameplay. It was like watching a Richard Lester Superman movie. Cool, very cool, but clearly doesn't understand the character and universe at all.",1
Hahaha wow that s a great call.,3
Hello Kevin Feige. Thank you for doing this and I just have one question that I have had since endgame. Is there a future for Harley Keener in the MCU? I would love to see him try to become a sort of Iron lad. Thank you!,1
"Everyone in america remembers 9/11, whether they were alive or not.",1
My favorite was her smile during the Stan Lee cameo.,2
Nebula in an avengers uniform was one of the high points of that trailer and I don't know why,3
My theory is he can hold the form longer because of all the quantum energy he absorbed.,2

Why isn't anyone talking about the fact that thanos' balanced sword shatters Captain America's shield? That thing is pure vibranium and only few can destroy it. So is adamantium a thing now?,1
"Tbh, they could have released only one single teaser only showing the Avengers symbol and the Endgame title, without *any* other promotional material at all and it would *still* break  1b at the box office, no doubt.",1
"Yeah sure, and then they make Last Jedi and gloat that we didn't see that coming (yeah, because it's stupid and unsatisfying and only a writer with contempt for his audience would do that...) But yeah.",1
Oof  I replied to the wrong comment. As you were then sry,2
Can I have one of your many hats?,1
Tony: You know me?   Thanos: I am your father.,1
Mods will verify me. I hope.,3
Iron Man is in a ship shaped like a dove at the beginning of the trailer. Tony Stark confirmed as the new symbol of hope for the Avengers!,1
I'd be more concerned with the fact that three of the six stones would have come from Thor movies. Seems like a bit much.,2
Unless they kill him off in that one properly to prevent future shenanigans on Sony part.,1
You didnt make  jokes about bumming 3 year old boys as a 40 year old working in the entertainment industry making many kid films...,0

This seems pointless,1

Not all of them. One of them was just posting bible quotes.,1

I know Disney said Avengers 4 will not be a part 2 to Avengers 3, but everything but their word says otherwise.

This is outrageous!,3

Thanks so much for the help! I should ve dug into it more before purchasing. I just saw it available and got super stoked. Hopefully the eBay user is compliant in letting me cancel..,1
"Hey Kevin! Thank you for the MCU. It's incredible what everyone was able to accomplish with these stories and you're a badass for being such a huge part of it.  My question is, was there a character or story you wanted to show or tell in the infinity arc that you were not able to? Maybe a personal favorite or someone you thought would work well in the universe etc.",1

"Scott Lang comes back when he s supposed to be snapped, cap thinks this is going to work, so they are working with Lang to do quantum stuff, the Avenger A is dust being put back together, they are in-snapping!!",1

"No, they've always been gods.",2

That's Ronan. Hawkeye is Ronin.,3
"Don't let him make you feel bad about it, there's a reason a good amount of people still consider Spider-Man 2 the greatest superhero movie of all time",2
Season 3 really wraps every thing up for Jessica anyway. Unless they decide to go down the comic route of marrying Luke. But that doesn't seem necessary and wouldn't be much of an arc for the character.,1
Hook was absolutely flogged by critics when it came out.,1
1B for Avengers 3 4,1
And anyone who disagrees with them are  locals . They don't get that a larger fandom outside their group exists lol,1
"Yeah, the writers said that but it wasn t clear in the film.  As for the arguments both ways, they ve been regurgitated so many times I don t even like to get into it anymore.  Still sad we didn t get a rematch or any sort of Hulk action.  On rewatch, I was at least a little more impressed by the holding up the mansion feat.",1

Is he in those movies too?,1
Thanks for demonstrating the concept of half,1
OHHH SHIT MA DICK S OUT !!,1
Thank you for doing this. 1. Can we expect X-Men and F4 to join MCU soon? 2. What are the future plans for Netflix characters? 3. SHIELD tracks mutants until Hydra infiltration is uncovered. Will there be a chance for them to cross paths with the kids from Runaways and Cloak   Dagger? 4. Will MCU have any impact on the shows? Thanos snap is a pretty big deal unlike AoU   Civil War.,1

"Your people call it magic, we call it science.",1
Oh well that definitely brings the experience down to a 9/10 at best,1
It's not an alias is the shitty part for him. He's literally Doctor Stephen Strange. ,2
I like Scarlet as an actress but as the movies went on her character started to suck. It seemed she was only around because she was the only female on the team. She has no powers and is boring. THen sometimes terrible bland acting by Scarlet.  In Infinity War the  she s not alone  was dubbed in. It was jarring when said. Horrible audio. Just like her character. Forcing her and Hulk together. Shitty.,0
My timbers have been shivered. ,1
"Vision plus someone from Phase 1. You can't build up this movie for ten years and not have a meaningful death to establish Thanos. No offense to Vision, but he wouldn't have the same impact as losing Cap or Iron Man.  Just as long as they don't kill Thor.",1
Can you say hi to me?,1
For what crime?,1
Donnie Darko style,1
This was incredible,1
I bet your buzzing you got to post this. ,1
What is a less popular Marvel character you d love to feature in a movie?,1
I love love love the music!,1
You just happen to know who chooses movie critics?  Why it can't be a woman of color or whoever else? Maybe they choose the critics based on their qualifications and not race or sex.,0

Hi Kevin! Thank you so much for doing this! My question:  Do you have any plans for the Marvel TV characters?,2
Out of the loop. Is there a public reason as to why James Gunn was fired?,0
So Hawkeye is Nora Durst from The Leftovers?,1
"Yeah this is my thinking. The writers and directors ideas both have merit, but unless it s explicit on the screen it s up to the audience to interpret. And it s fine that we land on different things.",1
" Weekend.  The days movies open are different in different countries, they just synchronized the best they could. Yeah, some days are earlier than the actual weekend, but at that point, you're picking at straws.",1
Turn your brightness up a bit.... or invest in better wires for your Blu-ray.,1
"Man I'm getting real tired real fast of Tessa Thompson. She was getting tiresome in the MCU, but after MIBI and Westworld... lets just say I hope they kind of let her be.",0
" SubvertedTrope  I don't think that definition necessarily applies to  subverting expectations  in a colloquial sense. Which is where I'm coming from. But also, killing Thanos early definitely works with that definition. We expect the villain to die at the end. How is that not an expectation?",2
Philanthropy is the new marketing ,1
"It's complexity as at the level where it certainly feels like magic, but it's just thousands of space saving measurements combining for huge data savings. For instance of two pixels are the same color from multiple frames, the compression alghorithm will just save the one frame ans repeat it till there is a shit rather than saving 24 plus copies of that one pixel.",2
What will be the new entity called? Marvel Studios Knights? They can't squander the brand recognition of Marvel Studios. Even Iger suggests a new studio for these films but the new name can't be too much of a departure from MS otherwise people won't think it's part of the continuity.,1
*Loki kind of jealous,3

Very good :) Tho your flair made me hesitate before up-voting your comment! :D,1

"Didn t realize the arm was black now! Big fan of the white star and someone pointed out that his uniform is reminiscent of comics BuckyCap  really may have to cosplay this soon! Only thing is, seems like he wouldn t want to use the Winter Soldier name anymore. Is there any other name he could take up? Also, I wish they d have someone release the official concept art already  I m happy to look at it on Disney+ but lame having to take pics of my laptop screen.",1
Exactly.  Not that hard to figure out lol,1
Guys?  Guys . . . Steve isn't dead.  He's just old.  Him and Bucky probably went for lunch after Steve passed the shield on to Sam.  They went to an IHOP.,3

Its unfair!,1
CLEVELAND ,1
"> Whoa, apparently he had to temporarily abandon Akira for this. Guess he thinks it's worth it. I'm more worried about the next season of What We Do In The Shadows, which is some of his best stuff (and highly underrated  please go watch it!). Taika should be able to do any project he wants at this stage, so there must be a good reason to do it. Thor 3 was one of the better Marvel movies overall, so he probably has a good idea what to do for the next one.",1
I just jerked off on your french toast!,3
"How sad that you feel you have to defend yourselves and the other mods! The post is funny to me because people are too easy to please sometimes, I never once thought it was an attack.  I'm so sorry for the absolute crap you deal with, you have battle scars my dude!  ",0
Is he holding the power stone? Because power level wise how the fuck is he holding thanos back even a little bit? Not underselling cap but this is pimp hand thanos ,3
"Personally, I m glad they left it out. Of course, I like Iron Man, but the constant arse licking can be too much for me sometimes. The funeral is much more powerful to me.",3
The Ancient One was Sorcerer Supreme and didn't wear the Eye either. Doctor Strange does not currently hold the title Sourcer Supreme. Wong states such at the end of DS and there has been no change in any MCU material.,2

"Well, he's Canadian.",1
"Things like this convince me that people must use different facial features to identify faces. Because it's immediately apparent to me he's not Schwimmer, and I'm definitely not a  super identifier  I started failing the facial recognition test as soon as beards and glasses came into play as possible disguises. Badly, too, I might add.",1
Dude there are thanks swords made from real metal and you STILL outdid half of them!,1
I don't think anybody has. Maybe The Dark World though.,1
The majority of this sub still stands against misandry and racism as it should. Captain Marvel doesn t necessarily have to share those same views that Brie does.,1
Of course it was less time have you seen the weekly drops for Endgame Avatar had mad legs.,1
Wait! Did i just watch it 50 times!?,1
lmao gotem,1
"Plus, it's deadpool we're talking about here. The only 4th wall breaking character in Marvel (that i know of). His films aren't dictated by the universe they fall under, it's the other way around. And Any appearance by character's in any universe are subject to his shtick. That's what makes it so likely for them to port him into the MCU. It's in the nature of the character to just roll with such things",3
like in civil war. personally i don't mind seeing less of some characters if it means others get more screen time and the storyline doesn't suffer for it.,2
This bothers me more than I would like to admit. And it s not even mine!,1
"A cinema in the UK actually says something like this right after the trailers during part of an advert telling people to turn off phones etc  'This is not America. Clapping is not required, and you certainly don't need to whoop to show the rest of the audience how excited you are'.",0
Their biggest mistake was killing him. But I don't know if he'll stay dead. She could bring him back  with her powers or the stone. Maybe she will absorb the reality stone to strengthen her powers.,2
"Brie Larson was probably the best pickup from Marvel, a Oscar winning actress that wasn't in many blockbuster type movies. A great actress who wasn't in the public eye as much.",2
This is our last trailer ,1
"You are correct that it isn't all done by one person but it's also not just groups of people doing whatever. Everything is overseen by Kevin Feige and his team of producers, they deal with mapping out where the universe is generally heading and do the quality control. With how much they are producing all at once now I wouldn't call Kevin Feige managing and overseeing it all  easy  but I do hope it all turns out good.",1
"I could get used to that. I ve often thought about the MCU taking really wild diversions from the books, which they have in some ways, but nothin that crazy. I dig it. But I also have faith that they will come to an agreement. Plus it skips the  Dick Rider  comedy of errors.",3
But he had a quantum suit and Pym particles for his mission to return the stones. I m sure he had a few extra particles for contingency plan trips. So he could ve just hung onto it after his trip to the 40 s and used it to jump back to the main narrative timeline after Peggy passed.,1
he just painted his armor.,1
Tbh glenn close played a pretty minor part,1

How do you suppress the existing soundtrack while keeping the dialog?,1
Yeah the original is a lot better. The music matches more,1
"Yes thank you! This is what I was inspired by to make the blast green. In Thor s banishment, Odin shoots the same orange colored blast out of mjolnir that he normally shoots out of Gungnir.  So it s either a green blast(like when Loki wields a hammer in the comics, he shoots a green blast) or she just summons necrosword with it( as was shown in the mural)",2
"One of the things I'm very curious about is, since the Disney/Fox  deal has been finalized, what's gonna happen with Deadpool in the MCU?

Both movies stand amazingly by themselves and alone.",3

Tom Holland is signed on for Sony s next film regardless.

That s Ronan. Hawkeye became Ronin. I noticed how similar their names are for the first time earlier today lol. But basically they re two different characters just with similar sounding names. Ronin(Hawkeye) is almost like a samurai in the comics.,1
I assume you take it off just like any other body suit.,3

"He s tied with Warwick Davis, and Jason Isaacs, but voice actors have more: like Dee Bradley Baker (12), Hank Azaria (5), Tom Kenney (5), Harry Shearer (5), and Dan Casellaneta (6). Also, Temuera Morrison has between 4 and 12, but that s just because they re all the clones 3 in the span of a year with a 4th 3 years after his last one is pretty impressive though. The others were mostly because LEGO decided to make sets about a story they were in, rather than a story they starred in",3
"I completely believe R-rated movies would do well in the MCU by themselves. The problem would be when they do the crossovers. Those R characters would have to be toned down to fit in an Avengers or team up movie, so it would affect their character.",2
"I disagree, they knew what they were doing by not raising them earlier and I agree with the firing now that they were brought to attention. Disney wanted to ignore it but they were forced to do something for PR, it's simple and I don't blame them at all.

So do you!  Throw him over the side.,1
They're not wrong Disney basically owns the box office now,1
Low key wanna see him mentor Morgan one day.,3
"Why do people keep saying stuff like this. Strange didn't control the future or choose the timeline, he could only see them. He knows on the winning timeline he hands over the stone to Thanos and they defeat him after the snap, but that's it. Everything else happened completely without him. Strange didn't choose the winning timeline.",3
Oh god no. Far from it.  But I still love it!,1
"Yeah, I want to know where it turned up after all this time.",2
I missed the part where that's my problem,3

"Not really a villain though. Maybe Baldur was, and Thor's kids got wrapped up in it. Thor just protecting his territory and wanting vengeance at this point.  Kratos was the villain for a long time. Now he just old and trying to find peace. Just wrapped up in Norse shit. Yggrasil will tremble.",1

*evidence you mean evidence. Proof is not the correct word to use. Just for future reference. Proof is his medical record/talking to doctors. His post history is evidence.

Have you met Brie? I so wanna meet her ,1
Daisy Johnson confirmed for Infinity War,3
So why do you Thanos needs to invade to Wakanda?,1
This is beautiful. Marvel fucking did it.  ,1
Probably because he doesn t want to deal with every new student in Kamartaj going  yo what the FUCK is up with your hands dude?? ,1
ZOVA VAGON,1
About time! ,1
This is the funniest comment I've read all day. A literal Bible quote.,1
Hi Kevin if you're still here could it be possible that the ancient one told cap he could go back with Peggy? He would have scene her dropping of the stones and she would know right?,1
We just didn't want to disappoint Barry.,1
Thanks for the advice  ,1
"Jesus, are you like 15 or some shit?",2
There's nothing more for me to give you. Let's make this the greatest ten minutes of our lives.,2
Best marvel anything to ever have been made I highly recommend it,1
 Thor and Thanos probably (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEg2mdR 7Pw),1

Love it. Very well said. Someone   Coppola,0
"I'm not speculating. That shot was 100  made for the trailer. I can't remember where, but I believe this  was confirmed. The shot existed to give a feel of what the movie would be, not to ever go in the film. ",1
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!,1
"Hey Kevin,  First off thank you for all the hard work you and everyone involved with Marvel Studios. I and many many more love these movies. My question is is there any marvel character that you haven t brought into the films that you hope will one day? I personally would love Squirrel Girl but I just wanted to hear yours. Thanks agains ",1
Nah none of Thor's crew was there old or new. It was just Thor by himself next to Hulk (Who had Thunderbolt Ross in the back but everyone else from his films still don't seem to exist),2
"Mr. Feige I'm doubtful you'll see this but I just want you to know that, as a hearing impaired person, I have the use assistive captioning glasses to understand films. When Hulk was reintroduced his dialogue was always proceeded by SMART HULK:   and it made me laugh quite hard. It was a beautiful little moment that no one else in the theater got to experience so thank you for that.",3
Movie?,1
Has a spinoff movie focusing on a popular side character ever been good in the history of film?,3

Never understood this statement. the door is closed...... FOR NOW   By adding  for now  they're purposefully leaving the door open.,1
I totally forgot Wolverine was in this movie.,1
It will. Stan's tribute will be in this one too.,3
No Korg?,1
And Captain Torch was just shooting a movie nearby,1
Surtur bought micro-transactions confirmed.,1
When she punches that old woman. Top fucking lel hahaha,1
Shoutout to whatever reddit user offhandedly mentioned they thought the trailer/tickets would drop at 9am eastern. Set my alarm (during spring break) and ended up getting the best seats at the earliest time at my favorite theater.,1
And it only took them two rereleases,0
Looked to me like he was trying to crush his face or just slap him away. The point is Cap is doing a good job at stopping his hand.,2
It only makes no sense if you re only interested in ignoring all the obvious benefits to fit your narrative ,1
"All the goddamn goosebumps. Spider Sense, the war on Wakanda VS Cull Obsidian (Black Dwarf), OUTRIDERS, Vision getting the stone/gem taken out of his head. Fuck, fuck, fuck.. I could keep this list going but it d become a wall.  I cannot wait.",1
Quick question. How are you a Redditor for years but have zero comments in your history? Is this a glitch?,2
I thought this too.  Daisy Johnson was in SHIELD for all of 6 days and she knew the basic history of the Red Skull.  Maybe they just never saw a picture of the RED SKULL and just thought that it was the nickname for the guy?,1
I hv a feeling wanda s accent will be back. They gave a solid reason why it disappeared. It should be back haha so yeah my guess is if Pietro returns he SHOULD have the accent.,2
Apparently either that kid at the funeral or his kid,1
I like your husband's theory. Kind of makes sense.,1

Thank you for this man. I had this idea in my head but not so flushed out.,1

Wasn't just reading reporting that Black Bolt actor and even Fiege expect a reboot to happen in Ms.Marvel?,1
"With Hawkeye on board there is no way they will lose. He would've aimed for the head, and hit ofc. Thanos couldn't even be mad about that, because at least he would've died to Hawkeye.",2
Imagine if its a Thor movie foe instance. They can make more or less the same amount on merch/toys and 800million more. Spiderman is taking up space.,1
"As stoked as we are for this, imagine how pumped we'll be for IW2 (or whatever the name will be) this time next year.",2
Maybe you've seen some articles talking about the first week / weekend records and stuff like that.,1
The Russos for sure!!! They have done this kind of thing before ,1

Stark s Hulkbuster Armor from Avengers: Age of Ultron (and comics),1
"Whedon confirmed it, as well.",2
"I mean it's very obvious they weren't dying in space, survive Thanos but to die of Hypoxia in the next movie would be such a blue ball and terrible writing and other than the fact we know that they survive space, we don't know anything else",1
Think those two ever got drunk and had sex?,0
"Wouldn t it be just as lost as the rest of Asgard, considering it was destroyed? Thor used it in this fight, but I don t think he had it when he was thrown out of the palace to the Bifrost.",3
I have a feeling it was all of them. He looks completely removed and changed as a character from who he was before.,2
greatest post of the day,1
"We've seen Strange rewind time on a larger scale with just the Time Stone though. Thanos didn't do anything new/bigger with it, other than it contributing to his ability to kill half the universe.",1
"Somebody, list their names please.",1
I miss mr stark,1
And that s where the MCU ends for me. Most of the new introduced characters just don t interest me.,1
Aye captain!,1
They lose the war without the nano suit. Thanos snaps again and everyone dies.,2
"Hawkeye: I'm exhausted. I need to sit down. T'Challa: Oh, he's kneeling out of respect for Stark. I will do the same. Carol: *sees a trend*",1

It makes a lot of sense,1
Hmm. Interesting. Do you know any other shows with this set-up?,1
Lmfao   im stealing this indefinitely,1
Makeshift Luke Cage on the right,1
Idk. I think Pym is supposed to be lightyears ahead of Tony and Banner. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.),2
"Agreed, she definitely said somewhere that she and the queen mother had survived ",1
Excellent!,1
Ya captain marvel Destroying the mothership is way better.,1
This reminded me of a video essay about marvel never uses themes right except for this one.,1
I can totally see a ... certain kind of American ... getting upset at all those people  disrespecting Tony Stark .,1
"Pretty sure its about renegotiations being made more frequently. Disney takinf 25  of the cut is a first. You have to SEE how it all goes first before you make bigger deals again. Hell, if this goes well, maybe they agree to an entirely new trilogy again with the character.",1
It s kinda underwhelming. I guess they didn t want to reveal too much.,1
Reminded me of Judge Dredd a bit.,1
"No problem! He also knows when the shield is coming at him, when Ant-Man is gonna hit him, and other such moments in the airport battle.  When it came to homecoming: the director didn t know how strong to make spidey-sense, so they just didn t touch on it all that much. He s still learning, remember!",1
He s in the shot with Cap BW and Rhoades,1
Avengers Endgame broke the WW record the same day as the SDCC19 Hall H panels,1
"If anything that s a positive as you ll have more quality control, which means people are less likely to get a bad taste in their mouth from say an Apocalypse or Loeb s  the Inhumans . I think you might start seeing people call for more stand alone type pictures, but I think that s a niche DC might fill given the success of Joker.",3
Endgame is the perfect title for this movie.,1
"Hey **Kev**, first time caller long time listener. How important was it to get Spider-Man into the MCU?  Follow up, besides Tom Holland portraying the web slinger was there ever an idea to incorporate Tobey McGuire (Spider-Man 2002) or Andrew Garfield (Amazing Spider-Man) into the MCU, could they have a place in such universe?",1
"Quick reminder: Enhanced humans, we aren't.",3
This post should be framed and saved for future talking points. It makes way too much sense. ,1
It was all automated ,3
What's the Valve curse?,1
Iron man is A) OP as hell with the bleeding edge suit B) Talking about settling down with pepper I m worried :(,3
SLJ final MCU send off? Gets shot dead in Deadpool but shouts motherfucker between getting shot and dying,2
You re embarrassing yourself calling Brie Larson C-List. Edit your comment and fix it.,1
"Everyone's on movement, Cap be like standing",2
"Ahh, got it. Thanks!",1
So things like that can get fixed in the blu ray for example? Or things like that aren't usually being done?,1
Less realistic than superheroes?,1
You damn time travelers are stressing me out.,1
"I cried a lot during that scene, that entire fight had me in tears of joy. I was so hyped. I was a damn mess lol love it",1
I hope it s a avengers movie,1
I get that.  I meant as why would they continue to make shows for netflix when they have a streaming service coming out themselves?,1
"Post Prof. Hulk snap. So they back to at least a few hundred, basically what we see here.",3
I personally want it to be after Endgame,3
They are hiding a lot ,1
"thats interesting i didnt know that, i just assumed it was a thing everywhere lol in germany its mostly movies with a length of 130+ minutes that get a break",1
Banner got sent back to earth somehow,1
"Is  The Falcon and The Winter Soldier  the final name of the show, or will *Captain America* be included somehow now that Sam Wilson has recieved a promotion?",1
"Fuck. I shouldn't have watched this... First, I can only get so erect. I've got the feeling this trailer is pretty spoilerous, a lot of red herrings probably, but still...",1
"I can see it now... Thor propping him up, Bernie style.",3

"lol, why does peter quill have a mustache????",1
Tell her her movie is shit and they picked her to fill a diversity agenda,0
Literally the last 15 minutes of Endgame is Tony Stark tributes. That s more than enough time for saving the universe arse-licking. Not to mention his presence in Far From Home.,2
"I don't know that GotG3 will come first. Gunn is working on suicide squad 2 right now, and GotG3's production start date was pushed back to 2021 (I am presuming that Fiege did this *to* get Gunn back). From the sound of this announcement, Thor 4 might be releasing May 2021 as the article states that Waititi had to abandon plans for Akira that would release in May 2021. Suicide Squad is scheduled to be released in 2021 so that is what Gunn will be working on next.",1
"If it's any consolation, there is absolutely no evidence of this. No article ever mentioned it.",1
What end? There are at least 20 more marvel films going to be made.. he's also got a chance for IW part 2 right?,1
"It can t be that valuable if they didn t teach you to spell  piece ,  clothes , or use then/than.",3
Ant-Man pulls up in his van from the Ant-Man and the Wasp mid credit scene. That van had the quantum tunnel in it. Do you think that will play a part? I don t know why else he would drive that van to New York from San Francisco instead of taking/hiding on a flight. ,1
More Luis is often a good idea.,1
Thought that was Christ the Redeemer in the middle.,1

"Well done, looks great",2
"Damn dude, did I hit a nerve? For starters, how do you know that Gunn was joking but Trump wasn t, what sort of magic power do you have that allows you to discover someone s intentions. Second, I would ve cringed if even one of those tweets were made, the dude made a fucking ton of them over the course of 5 years, ironically stopping after he became director of Guardians. ",1
Cup the balls,0
Ya I was wondering that due to Captain Marvel and Thor being so powerful now what the hell are they going to throw at them.,1
I fucking wish it is based on the Vision comic miniseries ,2

How has your role in directly dictating the narrative changed over the course of the MCU?,1
Weak trailer  poorly constructed   still pumped though!,1
"It really spoils very little, it s a lot of talking and infinity war footage, no thanos at all, still spoils a little though just who s where etc ",2
Why does Chris Pratt look like a swole Ed Sheeren in this picture?,1
I just wanted to say that I love your hair man. Ive gotten a lot of shit having it styled like that and you for sure rock it.,1
"Hello Mr Feige! Firstly I'd love to thank you for everything you did for millions of people around the world. The MCU is an unmatched feat in storytelling and cinema. My question would be, firstly, which avenger would you most want to be and secondly, which avenger do you personally most relate to? Thank you so much!",1
I honestly don t give a shit about Hawkeye and didn t really care that he wasn t in IW and even *I* got super exited to see him on screen again in the trailer. ,2

I feel I can ask this on behalf of everyone who has had a last wish that has t come true, please from the bottom of my heart, give this man closure. Let him see the fruits of your labor and his hope. ",1
"The point he is making is that during the duration of Infinity War, Thor is on a quest to get Stormbreaker so he can defeat Thanos. Once he gets Stormbreaker, he arrives in Wakanda. In Endgame, the same cannot be said for Carol, she is just off world doing super hero stuff, but we don't know what. That's the build up OP meant.",3
"I m actually glad this scene was cut. It s too extra, and we get the emotional payoff at the funeral.",1
Nice neglect of Ant-Man. Far more important than Capt marvel in the film. Did the artist even watch the film?,0
What are your plans on deadpool now being in the mcu,1
People genuinely just sort by controversial and downvote anything they see. Doesn t make sense,1
"if you add that chris evans also was part of the failures that were the first 2 fantastic 4 movies, it makes it even more impressive that they cast him as cap... i still can remember that this was something many people were quite upset about",1
Honestly I m most intrigued by the total lack of Doctor Strange.,1

"No, and why would anyone want that?",2
"Zemo was a human and he was in Civil War, but okay man. The movie is a comic book movie, idk what you expect when it comes to CGI",1
"No, it s right after Avengers 4.",1
"Good for Paul Bettany. He s been with this franchise since it began and after ten years he finally gets to show his face. Also, Thanos has better be good. Although they ve improved, particularly the last three, Marvel still hasn t delivered a decent villain since Loki.",1
Uhh everyone was expecting Tony to die.,3
"Hey man I appreciate you taking the time to go through my post history, that is incredibly flattering, thank you.",0
Isn't Loki a frost giant anyway? Where do his magical abilities come from? Do all frost giant possess these abilities?,2
You obviously don t have more than two brain cells. ,1
She also said that venom was part of the MCU until Feige corrected her. He could be playing silent to fuel speculation- the same way the Russo's use fake footage for trailers ,2
Hi Kevin  Just curious do you still have that marvel universe poster in your office?,1
I got you: https://youtu.be/ik8wgBSaHn0,1
"Well you re free to think that, I don t really see it that way. I m a casual of a lot of things, wouldn t make me feel bad if someone acknowledged that honestly. I didn t use it to put anyone down, I was simply bringing up the point that most casual fans I know reference the raimi movies when they think about Spider-Man.",1
Fulfilling some plot device about a lack of emotion is not a good tradeoff for hurting an emotional connection for the main character of a movie. It's just a very bad idea to do this.,0

"With very few exceptions, yes.  If being a mildly decent, functional person is the mark of praise in Hollywood, what breed of people are involved in that industry? Why is this something remarkable? Shouldn't this generally be the norm? It's like how Lara bars advertise something like  made with real food  because of the amount of garbage food being pumped out there. It's probably time to reflect on the state of things if we are enthused at very simple and otherwise common courtesies.",1
"Err...why is joking about raping three-year-olds just 'edgy', but comparing a black woman to a monkey over-the-line? I mean, they're both awful and possibly both of them deserved what they got, but I don't think any straight line you draw makes the former okay but the latter not.",1
Thats so quick and extreme haha they can use movies for that plot and stretch it out,1
Amazing how famous people get so much credit for doing normal things. Being a decent person toward others is like literally the bare minimum and something that should just be expected. I m not going to shower someone with praise just because they aren t a dick.,1

"I d say season 2 goes off a cliff after Punisher stops being in it. The finale just felt incredible anticlimactic to me, a bit cliche, a bit cheap love storyline which was unneeded.

Foshizzle,2
See what you did there,1
"Good job BP! Even though I though it was good but HELLA overatted, I believed that even if it was to be nominated for an oscars, it would be production design or costume design. It's rare to see a Neo-Advanced Africa in the media and i liked the costumes combining Futuristic and African elements. I did think it was a stretch that it was nominated for best picture, it wasn't that great. I want to climb Chris Evans' bones with his fine ass.",1
"It doesn't matter, I'm just saying that the left also digs up comments that are years old, I use Trump as he is an example everyone is familiar with. Anyway, Gunn is no victim, he got what he deserved for being a creep, let's move on. It's a shame he won't do the full trilogy, but whatever.",1
"Ok there, calm down, goober.",0
And he's limber enough to put his foot in his mouth while standing on the other.  I think the commentaries mention that's why he got cast.,1
A powerful scene for sure but the actual ending we got for Tony was much much better.,1

Yeah I agree. Like I said what she stood up for was a good thing but I personally did not think she handled it in a good way. It received bad press and she had to backtrack to get out of hot water. I also saw news articles saying she wasn t getting along with the avengers cast and then the whole thing on Jimmy Kimmel where she said she hated cast members and her and Sam L Jackson would shit talk them over text was a bit unwise to say.,1

Broad brushes let you demonize your opponents and not hear their side. ,0
I was confused for half a second why you were talking about NandoVMovies out of nowhere but then I saw the username. Feels like a small world on the internet sometimes.,3
"That or Matt or Vanessa get snapped or Bullseye kills her. Though to be honest, I don't know if I want that. Having him get out of prison again would be repetitive.",1

"killmonger is large scale, zemo is small scale. killmonger wanted to take over the world, zemo wanted the avengers to dissolve",3
A very nice and welcomed surprised today.  I just have to hold on for 6 more weeks...,1
The bottom part is a bit meh with the ppl walking,1
"Yeah and the reason MCU is popular is because they are master marketers. Maybe you could argue the sorry state of the movie industry as why any half decent original movie with known characters would be successful, but idk",1
"yeah Idk why that would have been an issue, with the freaking Infinity Gauntlet",3
"yeah, I definitely teared up a bit. And those tears made a waterfall at  we won, Mr.Stark . This is amazing. I m seriously speechless",1
"Tom Holland looks kinda gay in that suit, dunno know man",0
"True, true. He definitely was more jaded at the end of his career in the modern age. I think he accepted something about the world he always knew. Not that it would have stopped him from fighting for it.",3
What happened with home comming saying 8 years later? Was that a mistake? Is the timeline different then what we think?,1
Ya'll started the outrage mob era. Little late to complain when the monster you created devours your own.,1
Missed opportunity to hype both movies. Not that avengers needs hype. ,1
"From my experience, most businesses succeed on the shoulder of the executive assistant rather than the actual executive.",1
God damn I m so excited ,1
I'm actually shaking,1
I wanted to see a helicarrier,1
That s why the movie was good???,1
Are the tickets out?,1
"Yeah, like Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Jared Leto as the Joker and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man! Oh wait. Tom Holland was a lucky strike imo, as was the Nolan Trilogy. Only examples I can think of new being better than old in high profile comic book movies (no Affleck Daredevil etc.)",0
Dc,1
"No, not unless they want to open themselves up to lawsuits by people like Roseanne.  It would also shield people from being fired for making less offensive jokes ranging from vendors to people in the corporate structure and actors, basically by everyone working at Disney. If you let someone make jokes about raping and pedophilia, then what *isn't* allowed?  This is *Disney* we are talking about.   They had no choice.",1
I mean that s not a terrible reason to miss opening night. Just see it on Saturday or Sunday.,1
Wait until they find out Mysterio is the villain,1
I thought the first half of the movie was excellent. Once they escaped from Asgard and got to the dark world....that's where it went downhill for me. ,1
You can dislike an actor,1
"She s flawless, emotionless, and unrelatable. Give me a flawed hero like all of the rest of the MCU and I ll get behind it.",0
An origin/rise of Dr. Doom movie would be amazing ,2
You're thinking Auschwitz. Australia is that fake lawn stuff you see on football fields. ,3
One dude has a very pleasing baritone.,1
"First of all, Really like this trailer. It's literally just the main heroes reflecting on the loss of the first movie with no big action scenes. I guess I just enjoy this sort of tone. Second, surprised we didn't get a single shot of Captain Marvel. I was sure they'd give her the Black Panther treatment like last year where the Infinity War trailer included numerous shots of Wakanda and T'Challa.",1
"We get it, bro.  You vape.",3
I hope you didnt give her your opinion of a wrinkle in time...,0
" Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that. ",2
"Oh sweet Christ, thank you Lord. I don t doubt that another director could ve done an alright job, but now we know the soundtrack to this movie is safe.  I m imagining the opening of the movie we see Peter waking up on the Benetar, he plugs the Zune in, She s Gone by Hall and Oates starts playing, we pass all of the respective Guardians minus Gamora, sits in the captain s chair,  Where to, Guardians? ",1
"I mean, he was almost certainly talking out his ass on that one. At best, it was a potemkin village. But we have independent sources very specifically saying gamora was the last of her species.",1
Happy Cake Day!!,0
"I'd call these welcome surprises, not the subversion of expectations. None of those undermined the usual way of doing things. None seemed critical of the normal way either. There was no feeling of  we're doing it this way, we have the high ground!  The events just happened and were amazing.",0
That would be cool,3
WE LL DRIVE OUR SHIPS TO NEW LAND,3
Brought to you by writers of fast and furious 8,3
"The  both side  argument is applicable here. The alt-right exposed it because they knew that the oversensitive PC mob would lynch him. They take a lot of joy in weaponizing extreme liberals against their own.  In a world where South Park can rape a guy on TV and get an Emmy for it, I think that we can get over this guy's awkward jokes.",3
"Considering that Doctor Strange 2 is in development, even if he does die, he isn t staying dead",1
BRING...ME...THANOS!!!!!!,1
"That's what I'm hoping. Captain Marvel:  For Stan.  and maybe a photo of him. Avengers 4: Post-credits scene, a montage or slideshow of his involvement in the MCU, perhaps some outtakes or behind the scenes footage, followed by a big  Thank you, Stan Lee, from all of the True Believers that you have touched throughout your career.  and it's surrounded by all the signatures of the MCU cast and major behind-the-scenes folks like Kevin Feige. I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it.",3
So did Nebula ditch Tony lol,1
Avengers squad ,1
But le yearly property taxes on that thing alone have to approach if not be in the six figgies.,0
"If I was paying attention at the time and I heard they were going to have Thor in the universe, I would have been like  ...Eh ",3
But what about Maria! Rambeau deserves some love too lol. And hopefully gets powered up in the process.,1
"Well you haven t got the full list without RDJ, the man who started it all",1
"But in that case, Disney was buying Fox anyways.",1
It is genuinely disheartening so many people upvoted such a legitimately and demonstrably stupid comment. They objectively did not  happen across  Thor. Jesus Christ. ,1
Or he comes back with an Infinity Stone,1
Probably nonstop until the end of the next saga.,1
"Was hoping to see them refuse to shoot Vol. 3 with anyone but Gunn. I don't know the legal ramifications of that but in terms of getting Disney to correct their hasty mistake, I see that as the best way to accomplish it. ",1
"> Don't they only get 5  of the gross from Spidermans films? Oh, the Sony films that Sony makes and Sony distributes using Sony owned rights to characters? Those films?",1
He fucking better,1
Looks cool! ,1
So yeah...how is that possible?,1
And now hes on the front of the poster ,1
In the trailer? When did the rematch get confirmed?,1
Russo's trying to shoot hug scenes,3
At first I thought this was some behind the scenes photo,2
The Insight target list would have been a cool way for some Easter eggs.,1
"Shit man, if you can go five years with brain cancer maybe I do have a chance",3
I hope that there will be a director s cut with this scene included. It s too good to be a deleted scene.,1
"No question, just thank you",1
"Cape got caught in a revolving door, then was shot to death.",2
It s just the question of if it will be a reboot or not,3
Well......filibuster....,1
specifically i would like Annihilation to be an adpatation of Annihilation,1
Am I the only one here who thinks that s not actually her?,3
There's already a 2-part Phase 3 CE.,1
Sooooo buy Sony?,1
What s past the nine realms?,1
It's from Agents of Shield,3
Oh yeah no worries. I'm just glad the trolls didn't succeed. ,1
In Lord Feige we trust. Does the man yet have a star on the Hollywood walk of Fame? He might need a whole boulevard at this point.,1
ooo that's a bad look..,1
The transition between Tony most likely getting obliterated into Cap holding the gauntlet...ooohohhh had to change pants,1
I'd imagine Disney and Sony are still in talks about the other Spider adjacent movies.,1
And then there s Namor and Red Sonja,3
OH YES!,1
Did any of the sandwich that was thrown at you by Amy Pascal get in your mouth? If so was it a good sandwich?,1
Out of the loop what happened?,0
"different writers and directors would mean different interpretation. I direct your attention to, Avengers 1 Cap vs winter Soldier Cap",2
What about  no more mutants ?,1
Do you are have stupid,1
"Yeah, 1/2 isn t an amazing track record. By the same standard there have been no good Deadpool movies. ",1
I took a new photo this afternoon so I didn't accidentally dox myself,3

Good talk. Seriously consider putting technology down for a bit and just taking a break. Even half a day. ,0
THAT'S racist! Are you saying all Korbinites look the same to you?  ,1
We just call it alcohol. And it's only an issue if only one of the parties involved are under the influence and not the other. So since Ward lacks the superhuman abilities of Enchantress he wouldn't legally be able to consent.,1
Autographs. It's a very important thing and if you become famous you will have to create a new signature. I've seen this mentioned in a few documentaries.,1
That would be the finishing mixer more so than the editor. Take your sound complaint to them. ,1
"I wish I could watch it in 3D. Tried it once a year or so ago and those glasses made my eyes hurt, so I can't pull it off.",1
" Found it. (https://youtu.be/ Bax0dhSUhE) No mullet to speak of really, but that suit-up is a bit more complex than I remembered. Look at that completely unnecessary faux-telekinesis he uses to grab the helmet!",1
"It doesn t bro, everyone I have seen die in my life went in blissful peace, you will become one with the universe again. Don t listen to what anyone else says as the concept of time and reality is an illusion.

He s here you just can t see him,1
Have you read the crossover GRRM wrote of the two? It's  a duel between Rand and Jaime (url). He's got some fond word for Jordan tucked in there.,1
"HEllz yeah, but now we have to wait.",1
"Hey Kevin, my question is would you like to see the Donald Glover animated Deadpool series revived on Disney+? And possible side question: how PG will Disney+ be from what you know? Would it even allow R rated things like that? Ps. Thanks for the amazing movies over the last 11 years.",1
"In the upcoming Shang-Chi film, will he being using his abilities to make duplicates of himself? Also if not, will we ever see any characters with the ability of duplication, because I feel the psychological effects would be interesting.",1
what if they bought tickets to push themselves over the edge,2
"Who has written for the MCU that didn't make it into the final cut that we may recognize as  Oh wow, didn't know they liked this stuff ?",1
"I find it mediocre because of the movie itself. The over use of bad looking CGI just killed a couple parts for me. Most specifically in the beginning, when he first suits up and runs around. Couple frames of that look TERRIBLE.",0
>  her magic only enhances attraction that exists You mean like alcohol?,3
"It was Universal, whose film rights apparently expired in 2016 or sometime around there.  However, Kevin Feige has been somewhat cagey regarding whether Marvel Studios is free to use the character.  It's speculated he may have the same limitations as the Hulk, where Universal might have retained distribution rights on any solo film, but Disney can feature the character in other films.  But as with most Marvel character rights issues, Disney and Marvel aren't forthcoming regarding the details.",1
Wrong.  Proxima and Corvus are not in Wakanda. Black Dwarf (whatever MCU name is)  is in Wakanda like in comics... ,1
"Completely agree with you. I totally get that not everyone has the same sense of humour, but behaviours do have consequences, and your employer (and I think that's the key point, here) doesn't have to suck it up just because you're generally a nice person.",1
I especially enjoy the score at the beginning of this trailer with Tony. ,1
She's his adopted daughter ,2
Scarlett Johansson  has no eyebrows in this movie ,1
"Not true at all. Read the comments from  blue wavers  and  metoo  people on twitter calling for him to be fired. Child abuse comedy is not something that most people condone and while the outrage started as a troll thing, it caused actual outrage. Have a shred of honesty when you come here, my friend.",0
Then let's kill him properly this time.,1
CUZ WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH MAKE IT THROUGH,3
 World War Hulk (url) vs the X-Men ( 30 mins),1
"Tony was ready to give it to Peter at the end of homecoming, but peter turned it down. I think at least a few of the team would fit the bill to use an iron man suit. I mean Bruce was running around in the hulk buster.",1
Oh I see. Ive never considered realism to fall under what the definition of continuity is so that was my confusion,0
I just think they've gotten a bit better with it over time. There are for sure still some newer Marvel movies with this problem.,3
Meh.... no way he s anywhere near strong enough to hold off thanos.  He s about the same strength as black panther.  ,0
All that glitters is gold,1
I don't think I've ever wanted a villain to win like Thanos. ,1
I'm already so hyped for Captain Marvel. I will literally cry if we get Binary.,1
There's a reason why they call her Agent May,3
35 here and extremely pumped for this. ,3
"Avatar, Bargain come to We've",3
Then is that Rocket at the farm too? Another Rocket and Thor teamup?,2
His firing was because of the PC left. How was this in any way related to the alt right!? This was regressive left all day. ,0
I d imagine a parliament could still hold the country together. It s not as if Wakanda consisted of several states or opposing political parties.,3
Here. Right here is when I started crying,1
But neither are as cool,1
even in /r/marvel you wouldnt expect everyone to have read everything...,1

I just have 2 quick ones! I hope you pick them! Also thank you for EVERYTHING! We love you 3000!! What is the representation of the infinity gauntlet being left handed and the nano gauntlet being right handed?  What happened to everyone that was unsnapped by hulk? Did they just reappear right where they were snapped? If so what happened to the people that were snapped while flying a plane? Did they reappear in the sky?,1
"Which actor/actress is the most similar to their super hero persona/character?  Likewise, who is the most opposite? From a fans perspective, it seems like Chris Pratt shares a lot of commonalities with Starlord/Peter Quill, due primarily to wit/charisma.  Likewise, I would guess that Robert Downey Jr. is most dissimilar to his character, where Robert likely is very humble   reserved vs. the in-your-face, confident borderline cocky Stark. Thanks for all you ve done bringing this Universe to life!",1
"Because he is getting revenge, her is getting revenge...",3

*war paint skin activated*,1
I can still hear the audience going nuts and feel the relief that Cap might live.,3
"Both. I mean cap is always as strong as the plot calls for, but I think there is a larger context to the scene on why thanos is easily besting Thor and struggling with Cap",3
He's got his gauntlet to keep him warm.,3
This must have been around the David Schwimmer security cam thief time because that is practically the same outfit.,1

WHaTs A bLoCkBuSTeR?,3
Nothing short of amazing work... The only thing. Literally the only thing I could potentially say that does not degrade the video in anyway. The edges of the first scene are not covered in most of the other scenes. As such you can see white bar at the top and Hulks hair. I assume your comps got shifted down by a pixel or two or something to that effect.  I am also prepared to be downvoted out of existence for this.,1
Captain Marvel is going to save Tony,1
This really made me wonder what hero would be absolutely best for Tarantino because the only one I can think of is a joke (its Black Panther),1
The russo brothers tweeted this fan video last week :  https://twitter.com/Russo Brothers/status/1103383078532132864 (https://twitter.com/Russo Brothers/status/1103383078532132864) x200B It contains almost exactly the same scene and lines of Peggy and Peggy's funeral from Civil War mixed together. Funny co ncidence.,1
"MCU movies have always had a fair amount of comedic notes in them which I think have been balanced perfectly. Do you anticipate taking any of the future movies into a more dramatic direction, something akin to Logan?",1
"If we're being honest, I'm a bit disappointed in the size of his little green pecker.",3
What's next for Kevin Feige? Will you be closing your chapter in the MCU and moving on to bigger things or will you continue to grow what you have built?,1
"Well, thanks for jumping into the thread but I'm gonna go with, unless you've been living under a goddamned rock, you know damned well that this is the case and I'm not going to be arsed to spend precious milliseconds trying to wiki up a quote for you just because I'm neither Rainman nor especially interested in satisfying your arbitrary skepticism. ",1
"It doesn t matter what he does tho, he resets everything once he returns Mjolnir and jumps back to the bench as old Steve. But yeah I agree, he doesn t seem like the kind of guy that would cheat. He just did it for Peggy.",2
Steve and the Gang walking out of the facility looks like Captain Marvel or Tony just arrived.,1
They probably wanted to change it up a lil bit,1
"If I were them I wouldn't care about the non believers.  Why should anyone have to  prove  anything to a bunch of angry people on social media?  The only person I would feel the need to prove anything to if I were him would be Marvel or whomever if asked.   This whole culture of internet outrage over every single little thing, and the people who engage in it, can fuck right off.  No offense intended towards you.",1
porque no los dos?,2
Oh yeah. Kinda forgot about that scene/shot,1
Care to provide an example of Thor matching that destructive feat then?,2

For Spider-verse I'm fine with it because it's animation. And it was done smartly.,1
Thought you meant space-wise. Then you've been living under a rock. The Guardians have always been apart of the MCU...,1
Damn.... I don t want to wait after seeing that,1
"This was their fuckup from the start and they finally realized it. Giving kudos for undoing a stupid thing you did, when you had the power to do so anytime you wanted, is a bit much",1
No i mean he would be in a place he's not used to.,1
"NICE FAN ART, BUB",1
It is for sure...just it isn't as much integrated in it. Like you see the X-Men but never the lead ones. And the X-Men movies most likely won't acknowledge Deadpool too. But now that Disney owns Fox who knows...,2
Do you have plans to direct any future MCU movies?,1
Busy week for us then,1
My guess is that the jade eggs in her vagina saved her ,2

"Total will be 6 hours each. * Whether that's 6 full-hours (which would work really well for an action thriller like Falcon   Winter Soldier), 12 half-hours (which would work really well for the sitcom-motif of WandaVision), or 8 forty-fives remains to be seen. . * Other than What If, which will be 23 episodes, so unless they average 15 minutes each, it's going *way* over 6 hours.",1
It's comics. It's supposed to be a bit much.,2
"No, the old bitch wouldn't give up her seat.",3
"Hugh Jackman was 6 -2 , 5 -9  is significantly closer, and much easier to surround him by taller actors or use visual trickery to emphasize his shortness. As someone who is 5 -9  with many 6 + friends, it s easy to look very very short...",3

Baskin Robbins always finds out though.,2

"Was it GCSF you had for neutrophils? It hasn't worked for me either. One doctor mentioned BMT in passing, but I don't think she understood Fanconi Anemia.

Accurate statement. ,1

An advertising campaign can fail and not gain any popularity. But they still paid for it. Cuz they paid for the exposure for the chance to get the popularity. The content has to be good to be popular.,1

Certainly I wouldn't say the memorability of character names is not a major factor to a movie's quality (you can have great films without even naming them). But the fact Marvel did it in such a way that we knew and cared about so many of the characters along the way is a testament to the success of The Idea.,0

His death would definitely be the most impactful. Both for the characters and audience. ,3
I should just point out the guy is quoting Spider-Man trilogy lines r/raimimemes,2

"Just want to chime in and say that in addition to everything else amazing about this trailer, the fact that they lingered on the intro Marvel Studio opening credit, with each Avenger being drawn into the shot more slowly than all the other films to date, was a really nice and subtle touch that emphasized the EPIC scale of this movie and how important it is to the MCU. Just freakin' amazing. Marvel fucking RULES. Period, full stop.",1

One of her co-workers was just out of college and started to tell her a story about a new CD she had just gotten. She stopped after a sentence and said  oh, a CD is something you play music on, not a CD at a bank .

I don't know if it's just how they shoot him, his voice, or the tightness of the suit, but Holland just feels physically smaller than the previous two Spider-Men, when he's really not. Fun fact: Tom Holland and Tobey Macguire or both 5'8  while Andrew Garfield is slightly taller at 5'10 .",3
"They suggested the multiverse in far from home, so hopefully they do something around that",1

Important movie is important.  I believe he was made/told to watch black panther because of its importance in terms of black film making and its oscar nomination over it being a marvel comic book genre movie.,1
"I really hope the Black Widow movie sets up things that are important to the next saga. Otherwise it has a lot of similarities to Solo in being a stand-alone movie that s a bit out of place without having much of an impact to the overall canon. I have no reason to doubt marvel studios at this point, but I have to say I m a little nervous.",1
"Yeah, he has to live. If he doesn t, he can t see the outcome. That s a good point. It would be cool if they make that a plot point going forward. He has some guilt knowing he essentially deliberately sacrificed Tony for himself.",3

Hell yeah. This was epic. And for some reason Captain Marvel is criticized for being too powerful because she did exact same thing to Thanos' ship in Infinity War.,1

He is responsible for the mythology of my childhood. Amazing how many people his creativity touched.,1
"I feel that this should apply to Mystique as well. The version of her that I knew was a villain/anti-hero, only helping the heroes when necessary.

We need a Thor love story? We already had him lose everything and redeemed him self what else can you do with the character other then a love story,0
I don't think Thanos is even trying there. The way they edited it makes it look like Thanos is charging at Cap,1
"For real... Before Ragnarok, I really didn't care about Thor. Not that I dislike Chris, but I just wasn't interested in the character. But after the character's development in Ragnarok/Infinity War/Endgame, Thor is now one of the MCU's hero I'm the most excited to see again.  Really wonder where they will take the character.",3
Thanos is from the same realm as Strange . Other realms means stuff like where Dormammu inhabits for example,1

Literally bigger than his head.,3
"I would definitely say it s worth a watch, but most people would probably say that it s a bit too slow and a bit boring.

It wasn t made for her! ** Read this statement and think if this sounds a little bigoted. If so, you see why she has a negative opinion about her, just switch color and gender in the above and that was a direct quote. ",1
Thank you for doing this! My main question: You have been the guiding force behind the MCU and have redefined what it truly means to create the ultimate cinematic universe with a continuous and enjoyable flow from beginning to end.  What would be your advice to other people who want to do the same for the other major cinematic  universes out there or cinematic universes yet to be started? Thanks again for giving us the MCU!,1

"Who even said he was tortured? It s mediocre speculation. He likely did what he did with Gamora to him, showed him a bunch of dark shit and gave him the sceptre.

Hopefully others do the same. I can see RDJ wanting Spidey to stay too.,3
"You done screwed up by: a) just believing random people saying the movie was bad while ignoring its crazy box office and  b) allowing (a) to convince you to break release order and watch Endgame without watching Captain Marvel. Carol is best enjoyed in Endgame knowing her backstory, as you discovered.  Seriously, what did you think you were gaining by skipping the movie? I d have thought the studio s track record would buy your faith for one movie.",2
Thor could only ever fly using his hammer.  That's consistant with the comics. The lightning powers come from him (and can be channeled and focused by Mjolnir) but flight is something exclusive to the URU hammers.,3

"Hi Kevin, First of all congratulations for such a successful run on the MCU. My question is related to Endgame. At the end of the movie, the Thanos who has been killed in the future, is yet to make the  snap . Doesn't this negate everything and introduce some sort of parallax.",1
Backgrounds don t really matter in the trailers though... Look at the Ragnark trailer when Thor first throws his hammer at Hela. It was set in the city... but in the actual movie it was in the Sweden outdoors. ,2

Pointless .,1
This one definitely made me exhale through my nose in a very quick manner,1
"Clearly u guys dont know OP. we already asummed he was working on Pixar or Disney, after this video he made 3 years ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-6xk4W6N20 hes the legend who made Fan.tasia. Im susprised u guys noticed his Marvel video, he made it 9 monthsa go, and got posted here without no much attention lol.",3
Hey it's me Jonathan Schwartz don't ask for proof. Give me platinum and I'll uncancel Daredevil. I'm pretty sure that's within the realm of my abilities. EDIT: Thanks all! Daredevil is in the process of being uncancelled right now with Scott Buck at the helm for this season and beyond! Couldn't have done this without you guys!,3
I got really happy when T Challa said his name. I just thought  Aw he did care! ,3
"I can see it happening on Pornhub,  Avengers: Incesty Wars ",1
I'm confused what's happened,1
Did Galacticus sense (hear or feel) the snap across the Universe?,1
This is so weird to me. Why are they cheering? We hold famous people on such a strange pedestal.,1
"When Endgame was finally finished, the culmination of an incredible amount of work by yourself and many others over more than a decade, did you just take a minute to sit and relax as a well-earned reward for a job well done?",1
This was amazing! I felt the hype for each movie all over again! Thank you for creating this and sharing it with us all!!,1
"The more arrows in the thumbnail, the more legit the source.",1
I think he might be trying to say that he's anti weeb but honestly I'm not sure.,2
"I think I remember seeing previews for it. Looked interesting, will definitely check out now. Thanks!",1
People can appear and still be dead. Loki was alive for thousands of years. I'm sure he did *something* interesting during that time,1
I think they would do something like what DCTV did with Constantine. ,1
HOLY FUCKING SHIT BALLS. ,1
"It's certainly wordplay. That's not the issue here, though. It simply *being* wordplay doesn't mean it's an explicit reference to  I'm with her.   Edit: plus, I'd wager the people making a fuss over this probably think *Hamilton* is pandering, too.",2
"EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME IS A LIBERAL Or, how I learned to have cognitive dissonance, a u/TheCoochofMarlaHooch story. ",3
I'm completely on Sony's side one this one.,1
That kids dad gets to be star lord and emmet from the LEGO movie  He is probably the coolest kid in school ,1
This will never have enough upvotes! AMAZING JOB!,1
Thanos looks like a wrinkled thumb.,1
Run from it.,1
"Oh my god, that scene was fine. It was shallow fanservice, sure, but the entire fucking movie was fanservice",1
I honestly want to see Thor 4 as much as anything.,1
"Doesn t reveal much at all. I mean, it s still footage, but we still don t really know about the plot.",1
"Disney requires Marvel movies be played on X number of screens for N number of weeks, and those X's and N's are higher than they have ever required previously.",0
"Well, on Earth, any large mass of water increases in pressure by about 1 atmosphere every 10 meters of depth.  So depending on how deep the ocean was on Morag, lets say 1000 meters just to ballpark.  That's 100 atmospheres or pressure.  Now, Thanos has ships that operate in space and planets atmospheres so they are probably only able to handle atmospheric  pressures between 0 and 1!",3
Gotcha. If the name is the source of contention then you should know the character actually predates the Black Panther party by a few months. ,2
"ant man more like giAnt man ok im out, ive dun went hurr durr goofy lol",1
"> I would kill just to have ONE new good Superman movie that s just good old beating the shit out of bad guys and saving the day without the nitty gritty depression and inner conflict. No, that stuff can make superman great. What I want is superman from the justice league TV series to be in a big film. That's the best version there is, and we have not gotten him. It SHOULD be so easy to do, too!",2
Coulson was only there for like half a second...but like its about damn time. The Skrulls look dope. As did the scene with Carol and the Starforce flying through space.,1
Time to dissect every frame and see when exactly Ant-Man goes into Thanos  butthole,1
Bit of a Men in Black vibe from Fury's outfit and the alien dissection scene ,1
"if ur gonna take the time to create a new account just to insult a strangers looks, why couldn't u take the time to come up with a better insult. ",2
I hate to say it but I think Thanos is a real jerk!,1
Olivia Wilde for Emma Frost. She s actually a natural blond.,1
"u/go to heck dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives",1
So has everyone just given up imagining anyone else?,2
Well it s 4 years in between gotg 2 and infinity war so they could have just  bought  one from someone,1
Oh god. My soul isn't ready to see Rocket after he realizes he is alone.,1
"Hi Kevin, I want to thank you for this crazy awesome journey, infinity war and end game are such good movies and u guys really killed it. May I ask how much of the end game did Stan got to see before he passed away , and how was his reaction to it?",1
"Tony tried to sacrifice himself since the first movie, he's got PTSD from it, you know he's going to do it, he's even got the plan, Strange would know it's consistent woth e everything he knows about Tony but it's still a dick punch to the heary he willingly runs towards this  fate.",1
YES FINALLY OH MY GOD IT'S BEEN NICE KNOWING Y'ALL,1
I thought the Kree-Skrull war was over. Wasn't that why Ronan the Accuser was so pissed during GotG1? ,1
Even Thanos would be like:  Fuck that noise. ,2
"Well that's also my point, if the snap is something that definitely does happen, then it means he succeeds in getting all the stones. If he can just kill *half the universe* with a snap of his fingers then how can they possibly win after that? My guess is the movie will either prevent it from happening or will go through with it and maybe Strange uses the time stone to reverse things?",1
Oh god. I got the shivers,1
At this point we don't need an origin story... It's too late for that. Now is the only time you can do a post - IW pre-EG series,1
To think decades of work were nearly destroyed by some slutty nurse too. RIP to the Shakespeare of our generation.,1
 When someone tries to tell you Infinity War spoilers (url),1
BUT WHERE IS ANT MAN?!? :((,1
On. POINT. ,1
It made me really happy when Skurge decided to be a hero. It was impressive watching his emotional arc just through Karl Urban emoting.,1
They already filmed it and said it would be for one episode in the season. They were highlighted at the end of the  season 3 trailer (url).,2
Can you make Groot get a gun in GOTG3? I'd be my dream come true,0
"You're right. The majority are ones who bring in the money. Also because of bathroom breaks, no one is ballsy enough to wet their pants during theater.",3
I had a plan!! You just needed some gaaddahmn faith!,2
Later echoed by Simmons against the tentacle monster on the Hydra planet,3
In these situations things change fast- sometimes it s better to have faith in humans than be cynical. And after all- he s Australian! ,1
Ultimate Hawkeye had a family,3
"This is why, as much as I enjoy DC, I hate their lazy 'idk, who's hot on the snapchat right now' casting decisions. They get a bunch of empty recognisables with little to no acting skills who second-hand embarrass the audience when trying to share screentime with  the actors who are actually actors.",1
"Tony   Rocket both use snark/sass as a defense mechanism. In finding out that his salvation is fucking TALKING RACCOON (  not his own genius) would definitely put Tony in Snark mode. Rocket getting confirmation that all his friends are dead would do the same. (Except Nebula, but I don t know if they d consider each other  friends .)",3
It's funny how he never uses the shield or any energy weapons in the rest of the movie,1
"Holy shit Mysterio's suit isn't just real, *it actually glows*",1
Really excited for  More Thor ,1
It's fine by me.,1
volto a perguntar: COMO   QUE EU N O TE VI???,1
"Let them come! I have no fear, for Talos is my ally and I am his prophet. His word is upon my lips, his voice in my throat.",1
"People are worrying too much about this. I was worried at first, but I doubt the negotiations are completely over.",1
Nat s hair is red with blond at the end. It s grown out. ,3
"Not necessarily an alternate casting idea, but I would love it if there were an MCU equivalent to the Ultimate universe, (Or some form of MCU Earth-2) and all the characters were played by actors that ALMOST played them in the MCU. Tom Cruise as Tony, Glenn Howerton as Star-Lord, Adam Sandler or H. Jon Benjamin voicing Rocket, etc.",1
Of course they will. Look at what they have done with subpar stories. They have made masterpieces and added to the fabric of their mythologies.,3
I've seen Slither and really like it. I would love to see him do more like that.,1
But they did know about Thursday.,2
WHAT THE FUUUUUCK,1
"Yeah I get it, thought I was making a cute quote reference, didn t read between the lines. I accept the consequences.",1
Just shave off all of toms hair,0
She's the only one smiling too. YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!  (/s),3
I'm already hyped enough without seeing another trailer. I would actually rather go in with as little information as possible rather than see any trailers that will make me start theorizing. ,1
I was expecting the one with where Josh Brolin contributed to the snap,1
"I mean now that Endgame is over the fantastic four is literally THE thing I m most excited for. That and to see Spider-Man take on 5 or 6 baddies at a time in his next movie. I can say that I have faith in the MCU to do it right in time, but I m also an impatient bastard GIVE ME DOOM  NOW ",2
"Gee, I wonder why",3
The joke here is that Chris Pratt is a very religious person who belongs to an extremely  anti-LGBTQ church. (https://www.houstonpress.com/arts/chris-pratt-fails-to-address-his-churchs-lgbt-problem-11222232) So consider that before you downvote my friend here.  The real downvote should go to Chris Pratt.,2
Should've started the video five seconds earlier with his arrival on Earth.,1
To undo the snap.,1
AHHHH.,3
"who says that tony is stuck in space straight after the snap, it could be the end of the film...",1
"500 for OLED vs QLED in the same general class   size. I just bought a 55  C9 for  1450, the equivalent QLED was about  1000",2
"I agree, even though I fully understand why most would disagree. But he's my favorite Marvel character, so I just can't help but want him in the MCU as soon as possible. That said, I have two requests: * Cast someone short, please. Jackman was great, but I don't want another 6ft-plus Logan. * Introduce him with Hulk vs. Wolverine!",1
That s Colorado Captain!! Check him out on Instagram (coloradocaptain). He does a ton of charity work!! Got to meet him at Denver comic con last year. Really awesome dude ,1
"If he just needs to hold them in his hand, what was the point of getting Peter Dinklage to make him the gauntlet in the first place? He could gone with any object",1
They fucked themselves hiring Snyder. THANK THE MAKER we got the Russos and Feige. ,2
No the fandom has not becoming toxic.  Twitter is just a cesspool of trolls and troglodytes.,3
Y all are some fucking creeps Edit: everyone in this thread ,2
My favorite part is how before he is even fully suited up he has already put up the shield to protect hawkeye,1
"I was just gonna say, couldn t the face mask just come on like the rest of the suit? But yeah this is better",3
"You know. If you had told me that the way to elevate a Daredevil tv show was to add the fucking Punisher into the mix, I would ve said you re out of your mind and that your fan fiction is best left as fan fiction. But god damn, DD and Punisher worked really well together.",2
Exactly. Captain marvel and Captain America were boi prequels,3
Which actor/actress was the most fun to work with?,1
Your greyhound is very impressive. You must be very proud.,1
"Hey Kevin, thanks for doing this AMA. My only question is: for the spin off show  Falcon and Winter Soldier  are we going to see Sam as the new Captain America? Or will he still be Falcon? Loved Endgame!",1
Not sure how they do Cul without his origin feeling awfully similar to Hela and Malekith,1
For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing,3
"So if the New york is empty,  that means our netflix heroes are also gone with it. That's why the cancellation and no cancellation for punisher. May be he was the one who survived. I think after end game the gonna revive back all the characters on netflix also. ",1
Terry Crews,1
"Hi Kevin, that's an amazing show, you should give it a try, you would enjoy it!",1
No way he would even if he was because I think it sets a bad precedent for expectations and speculation fans could have.,0
"Many are going to die, cliffhanger style. -said it... First?",1
"Not really Thor, but the action and movie in general. They clearly wanted to create that moment, so they probably toned down the action so that the girls can save the day. Or maybe I'm just extra salty because I watched it right after seeing Captain Marvel which was garbage",0
It's not.,2
Looks like you forgot to make this comment trump related unless the  shithole  reference was about him so I guess you actually killed it. Good job being racist.,2
"Yeah, I can tell that. Still larson is thumbs down from me. It's gonna be similar iron fist and black panther situation where support cast easily over shadows the lead.",1
It's so *cute.*,1
The Golden God!!!,1
What about hawk and dove marvel version? (Forgot the name of the show),1
Well... I stand corrected. Do this please. Only Wolverine will get demolished lol.,1
"It's why she walked from the sequels. She signed on to play Jane explicitly if she wasn't a damsel-in-distress character. She wasn't originally, then become one, and then Portman walked.    Endgame spoiler: >!Portman filmed new scenes for Endgame, and has mentioned being open to returning to the franchise.! ",3
"OK then, edited, in that case I wonder if Bruce isn t in there due to CGI.",1
"I m not saying he couldn t, what I m guessing is they are using that as their reasoning. Self doubt plays a big part in whether someone believes they can do something or not. Even if Thor can, maybe his doubt is telling him otherwise. But nonetheless, again, he was still able to summon Mjolnir, so he clearly is still worthy. That s what could kick off this new character arc as we ve already seen the upswing towards the end of Endgame",1
Now we wait for Trailer 2.,2
He is famous for creating comic books about ordinary world without super heroes.,1
> head cannon Is  this (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/f/fc/Showdown at Circumtore.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120407185647) it?,1
So glad they left that out,1
u/redditdownloader,1
The big question is whether Marvel should reboot them as a film or as a Disney plus show.,1
Oh thanks I m crying now,1
"Sorry if my response seemed callous, that wasnt the intent. You gave a better summation of what I was trying to convey.",2
Let s do it.  Russo Brothers  ChrisEvans you get the idea! Let them know reddit!,1
I'm afraid so too because otherwise it doesn't make much sense that he's expecting Pepper to rescue him in space.,1
"My bad, I was excited and I wrote it fast",1
"Oooh, that s an interesting point. Complainers can be so vocal on the internet that it s easy to forget that their bark is worse than their bite.",2
Yes! Perfect trilogy will exist though! *Tear of joy*,1
"Honestly I like this. My one major complaint with the MCU (particularly the more recent Russo movies) is the muted color grading. It's not bad, but I just prefer vibrant colors.",1
Just a little rock joke for ya!,3
Thor Ragnarok literally changed my life so i'm super hyped for this one lol,1
Oh lol. I m on mobile so I didn t see the link that clearly haha,3
I wish I grew up on comics and comic book stores.,3
Agreed. It wasn t much but it was palpable. Now I want them together. ,2
I will wear my vag-egg while she is on screen.  I'm  a  man.,2
Look its a bird its flying high above! Oh you didn't see it? It was right over your head tho.,3
Peter's arm hair standing up = all of us as soon as the trailer dropped.,1
"Yeah, I don't have a problem with Disney's decision but if people really think James is a pedo that's absolutely insane. They were just some edge lord jokes from a dark comedy writer/director.",2
"> Roseanne has been an advocate for gays and minorities her whole career. She's done so much for those groups in the past, and even now. How so? Sources? > She had a cross-dressing grandson on her show. Her son was in a mixed-race marriage on the show. She tackled Islamophobia on one show. Don't give a fuck what she did on her show. It's a show that she didn't write. > Not to mention her husband's best friend and business partner was african-american.  Source?",1
What's to note here is that it seems like Thanos is unsuccessful with his attack on Vision (My guess is Cap and crew reaches there just in time). As of now he only has the tessaract and power stone. ,1
"This work is amazing.  What do you do when you do this?  I mean, you do more than just take a bathroom selfie don't you?",1
the one in the bottom left of the group of four pics looks like Asajj Ventress from the clone wars,1
Saw it a second time. Biggest reaction from the audience was Clint losing his family. Right at the beginning. Nothing compared.,1
PLOT TWIST: END GAME is not the real title of Avengers 4  ,1
"Hey Kevin, just a tiny question but do you know why the colors for Captain Marvel s uniform were inverted in Endgame? And will they remain that way for her future appearances?",1
"ah I see.. But still, DC doesn't look like putting an effort trying to compete with Marvel...",1
When people kick junk they see that respecting everyone is the only way to true happiness. ,1
Die at the same time!,1
Nobody tell Aang.  jokes,1
"Well tbh that's actually a good reason *to go* in that direction, unless RDJ himself advised against it",3
Someone give this man a platinum,1
"idc about the cleavage, but I just love the jacket and sleeves in the first one.",2
I have seen the movie. Your comment on her smiling is to a real life picture. Not a movie. ,1
How is ant man out??????,1
This guy looks a lot like that Drax guy,1
"Infinity war is great at delivering on the promise of  the MCU crossover we have been waiting since the original Avengers . The fact that Thanos wins is also a great story beat that will probably be remembered for years to come. But Endgame is a celebration of the MCU, and a send off to a bunch of characters that we have loved for 10+ years. I enjoyed both equally, but Endgame gets me because of the emotional weight it carries.",1
"I don't think there's anything really surprising in the trailer that we haven't seen on packaging or concept art. I don't know how much OP has actually been paying attention to, so I didn't want to point  those out.",2
I was hoping she did this to Thanos in IW,3
This guy knows. Doom can be main bad guy for one movie but his main draw is fan-favorite anti hero.,3
"Oh sweet mother of mercy, he's back!",1
"What really sucks is the home release of Endgame has these horrible bars on top and bottom cutting off a third of the image. The full imax version looked so much better, it s a shame how many scenes now have the tops of peoples heads cut off. :/",1
Oh well guess I have to go rewatch all the marvel movies again,1
Is this alexander?,1
How did you convince Sony to let you use Spider-Man in the MCU?,1
"Thats about it. Which in turn highlights the problem that they didn't really give him material. Realistically, that was a very minor scene compared to the rest of the movie.",2
I feel where you're coming from but I also really want to see you try to make RDJ say something.,3
I think she got her time to shine enough without taking the thunder from the OG Avengers. She did well with the limited time she had in the movie. Iconic stuff really.,1
Wonderful!!!,1
We'll just have to agree to disagree then.,1
I have wondered about that. The current MCU has no stones anymore. I wonder what that will look like.,1
Looks like Thanos is doing it himself...and enjoying it.,1
"Hey Kevin. There's a guy on Twitter named Roger Wardell who leaked accurate info about Endgame several months ago. He has claimed that you guys at Marvel are developing several projects, such as: - A Thunderbolts movie/possible trilogy - A Black Knight movie - A Power Pack Disney+ series - A Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel Disney+ series Do you have anything to say about these claims?",1
People are fans of the MCU characters and actors but I am a huge fan of you Kevin Feige sir. You have been a huge inspiration for me.  I have always wanted to know your process behind choosing which films to make and how do you plan on weaving a narrative thread that goes on for 10 years through 22 movies and concludes with an epic like Endgame.   How do you even comprehend all that ?    I am really curious to know your process. Thanks for doing this AMAA :),1
One of the OG6!,2
You're welcome :),1
"That makes me sad, avatar was my favorite movie growing up.  No diss to endgame I was just glad avatar held the title.",0
Someone commented in the original thread about his firing that Disney is in sort of a power struggle at the moment and the strange moves you're seeing around his firing are a result of no one wanting to appear weak. It does explain quite a lot.,1
"It's probably gonna be captain marvel, but by God I wish it was korg ",3
"I think everyone is just itching to have this movie come out to start piecing together more of Avengers 4.  We re little less than half a year away from release so what we have now is just a teaser. I ll agree there isn t a huge iconic moment in it(Ragnarok s teaser has Hela catching mjonir) other than 90 s Fury and Coulson, but there could be more to this story that those moments could be huge spoilers.  ",1
The nerf-herders,3
If you can remember when it was posted I might be as to find it. I know I saved it,1
Awesome! Glad to here that,3
"but if strange worked out his magic a bit more, couldn't he just orange lights himself a magic iron man suit?",1
"Yes, this!",1
This looks like a fighting game where half the characters aren t unlocked yet ,1
"Seeing the ever-so-stoic Strange kneel as well, even though he knew this had to happen, really hit me.",1
It because he knows that Cap just gives off a Cap type vibe. You can't help it  it's just what your body wants to call him.,1
When can my action figures from television play with my action figures from the films?,1
Shouldn t this be a spoiler?,1
"I bet he will go to another universe as a goodbye in MCU. It closes him out, let's him continue with Sony and leaves the door open.",2
"That would be crazy cz then we d get Jensen Ackles as Hawkeye, which is a dream cast for me tbh!",1
Certainly not. No one knows him at all. But Marvel does a really good job sticking to the characters looks. At least in their initial appearance.,1
Possibly in the van?,1
"They're brought together to be pinch hitters. In other words  by the time we need then, a bunch of people have already died Edit: I've read two other threads in here, and damn, reddit loves baseball or anime.",1
Get this higher,3
A really damn nice teaser. x200B Chris Evans' acting looks impressive. That look he has from the  therapy group  says so much.,2
"And I want to see a call back to Endgame and have Dr Strange try and punch Banner out of Hulk like the Ancient One did, but have it fail. Strange will give his, oh shit, that didn't work as expected look, and Hulk gives his patent snarky half smile and continues to rage smash with impunity.  IIRC he was on an unstoppable rage fest when the Fantastic 4 sent him to a peaceful planet in the comics but he ended up on Sakaar, so the MCU would have create a different storyline.",1
What do I have to do to buy Tom Holland lunch,1
Cap's reaction to it destroyed me,3
Did you just ignore my whole second paragraph?,1
"I, honestly, double checked the date when I saw this post, just in case. ",3
"As far as I m concerned, those fools at Sony have got to reconsider. Because they know good and well that Marvel fans would be devastated if Spidey was taken out of the MCU so soon, right after Spider-Man: Far From Home managed to make a billion dollars at the box office. Besides, it would also be disappointing if Tom Holland s own portrayal of the character didn t get a chance to also interact with the Fantastic Four and several members of the X-Men.",1
"Exactly, it was his last cameo, I was expecting something a lot better, is all.",3
Do celebrities have some sort of autograph class they all go to or something? Can I go to one?,1
 YEAH BABY!!,1
"At the end of the day, many would say that making an engaging character is more important than a blind devotion to  the way it is in the comics . Which isn't to say that you couldn't have some of both, but simply saying  It's not like the comics  isn't a great point on its own.",1
So.. where were those Wakandan fighter jets during Infinity War?,1
That tears from cap :(,1
"He did, you can look it up.  That's the whole point. ",2
I can't even see how many upvotes this has. Ayah,1
"The Marvel comics universe. That could be a pretty interesting event crossover. Not sure if the comics characters should be played by the same actors as the MCU ones or if they should pull a *Who Framed Roger Rabbit?* instead, though.",1
I had the cool Gears of War one. Fucking loved it ,1
Real or not you get my vote! SEND THIS MAN ON A EXTRAORDINARY TRIP TO SEE ENDGAME AND FILM IT! THEN RELEASE IT AS A MOVIE TITLED: MARVELS FANBOYS  bam on top of getting to see it early you are now a star! Good luck and much love to you sir!,1
Ok. You done? Or what?,1
"Tears bro, congratulations my man!",1
Also note that they waited until after the close date had been set for the Fox deal. I d have to imagine that Disney was a bit concerned about shareholder price drops.,1
"Hah no worries, definitely not saying that, I don't know the guy from anything besides GotG and wouldn't have even known about his past work if not for these tweets coming out. ",1
hi kevin!! not sure if you re allowed to answer this but what are the chances of another thor movie? possibly with taika as the director?  questions aside i just wanna thank you for bringing this universe to life and making all these movies possible. i was a kid when im1 first came out and now i m almost an adult i loved growing up with all my favorite characters  3,1

How boring do people think you are?,1
el cocko,1
"This is a really elegant way of saying nothing and not taking any stand. Hey guys. Remember when that thing happened. Wow, what a thing. Things like this sure do happen. We don t want anything to change. We don t approve but we don t condemn. Can we be on both teams? Are we all a team? Thanks. ",3
"Exactly. It d be similar to when George Lucas dies. It ll be really sad and we ll be thankful for what we ve gotten, but what we enjoy now has continued way beyond his involvement for a while. ",3
Shows nearly nothing. I love it,1
Just like we helped Kylie Jenner yea!,1

"Wait, what's that about Lauer?!",1
How about avatar 2 for starters.,0
"Yeah absolutely. And IIRC I think part of that (ugh) Fantastic Four reboot was produced by Matthew Vaughn so that slightly worries me.  Like you said, creative control is needed- like Kingsman, First Class, and even Stardust.",3
Rewatching infinity war and Dr strange says  we're in the end game now  after giving thanos the time stone. Whhhatt. Blew my mind. ,0
This is more like BMW vs Mercedes. Both great cars in a similar area but people have preferences.,1
"Disney was earning 100  of merchandise sales profit though on spiderman products, which is probably more than what Sony was getting from the films.",3
"If it was an HD Sony XBR from the early 2000's, it would look terrific.",1

"The guy interviewing that cat deserves props for making the best out of that situation. Unless that interview was his idea, you know he s thinking  I went to years of school and worked for years and now I have to interview this cat? ",3
"They probably thought you were going to start posting footage from the actual trailer (aside from the shot with Cap and the staff), but either way, they still lost, since you showed us stuff like the Guardians of the Galaxy scene, which we probably would have never seen in that stage, with the unfinished CGI/special effects.",1
I am a really okay with our prime timeline getting Krasinski in a few years along with Emily Blunt when they bring Fantastic Four into the MCU,1
You are amazingly talented. Thank you so much for this friend.,1
"I'm pretty sure it'll be a full-on franchise, unless it does super badly at the box office (which I doubt will happen).",2

"Is Howard the Duck stronger than Thanos, and who would win if they were to fight?",1
"Hey Kevin, just want to say first of thank you for this amazing universe you ve created and congratulations on all the success you and everyone over at Marvel have received with Endgame. Yous deserve it.  In Endgame, James D Arcy reprises his role as Jarvis from Agent Carter making him the first TV character to appear in the movies, going forward will we see other TV character show up? I d love to see Daredevil or Ghost Rider.",1
True but I don t think avengers is going to be an open world it looks still good as but it might not get as many sales as it could if it was open world and if what your saying is true than they probably won t look into other games ,1

I think the hype has gotten some people expecting a lot. Then they'd complain too much was given.  This was a teaser trailer and good enough. Movie doesn't come out for 7 months.. ,1
"It's not so much about fixing the timeline, because it's an alternate universe's timeline. If anything, I feel like Cap would take advantage of the situation to make things a bit easier, and just hand the Aether directly to that universe's Thor.",1

"Hi Kevin! As someone who's watched every MCU film, I cannot give enough thanks for the endless entertainment! Now, my question is, how do you manage to coordinate between yourself, any Dinsey execs, and all the different directors to maintain consistency amongst the movies in the MCU? Thanks in advance if you answer my question!",1

I don t disagree that Shakespeare, Marvel and Plautus all follow in the romantic traditions of hero tales, but that doesn t mean that all hero tales are equal or that Marvel is of an equal literary quality as Shakespeare.

"He better not be. Brie Larson is the future of the MCU and she should be leading. She s actually advocating for LGBTQ representation in the MCU something RDJ never did. She s the best MCU character we ve had, better than that drug abusing RDJ, glad he s gone. Brie will make everybody forget about him soon enough, Brie will revolutionize the MCU and cinema. She is literally the only Oscar winner in the MCU right now so she s also a better actor than Tom, RDJ and Evans.",0

"No, you just wanted to make it about your political views and with a lot of assumptions when you know very little about me. But forget about me as you already slapped a label on who I supposedly am. I am more curious about who you are. Why do you see this as a strictly political thing? Do you really see people that divided.. either far left or far right and everything anyone does is about politics? And why do you make judgment on people so quickly?",1
"Hey Kevin, I'm curious on what your thoughts are on the current canon of the MCU. What do you consider canon? Is it just the movies and one-shots, or does it expand to TV shows like Agents of Shield, Agent Carter, and Daredevil?",1
This would ve been cool as shit,0
"The downvote bridgade rolling through here is expected but no less pathetic.  How dare someone question the logic of our precious MCU!  Grow up downvoters, I m just trying to have a conversation.",1
"Looks like the scene was only half-edited, fully editing every shot made would be more expensive. This should be enough for the director to select or reject a scene, if accepted finishing touches and refinements would have been applied. You can see some funky greenscreen and missing CGI on costumes, which makes this shot super interesting from a behind the scenes perspective.",1
"It is sad. It is not tragic. Yes, the man was 95 years old. But he and his creations are beloved by hundreds of millions of people the world over. He *created entire universes* and made comics that writers are still building new series or movies from. The man is a global fucking treasure, so yes. It is sad as hell he died.",1

I know this is humorous sarcasm but I just want to say the world would be a better place if people realized you have to choose to be offended in many cases. You are making a conscious choice to have outrage. You can call out offensive things without being offended yourself.,1

"231  7.7  is insane. He was likely juicing at those numbers. The 675 squat was probably faked though. Contrary to what the idiot said on the quora link, that s not even close to a world champion squat (current record is like 1095) but it s definitely elite. It s very unlikely he got that strong, even with PEDs.",1

"Hemsworth, Cumberbatch, Holland, Boseman, Larson. In that order.",1

Look behind the Wasp when she walks through her portal.,1
They pretty much always have these but it s a waste cause they go over the entire thing after the fact with CGI to make it look  clean   Notice how Spider-Man s suit in the films often looks so ridiculously skin tight that it s impossible. Like there is no slack at all under the arms or anywhere. It makes them look less realistic imo compared to these physical suits that look amazing on their own,3
Rocket and War machine was easily the most badass scene of the trailer,1
the Ancient One never ever stated that,1

Hi Kevin What are some comic book recommendations for fans of the MCU who want to get into comics?,1
"That's exactly what I read it as, haha",2
I think so. I don t think it s the physical attributes that make you worthy. It s who you are and what kind of person you are. Even pre-serum Rogers was still brave and wanted to fight for the  good. ,1
This is where I knew him from! Loved him on Everwood!,1
You should get an award for making my day!!!!,1
For real! I did not even spot him in the movie. Very excited for that in GOTG3,3

Thanks. I really don t remember this scene.,1
"yes,you always watch the series when they end,then binge watch in like 2 days,doesnt cost you much and its cheaper than going to the thetre",1
"It would also make them fucking pointless.  Here's a show about a well-established character that's been tied into the universe you love for decades, but THE STORY DOESN'T MATTER!  ok yeah no Comic book readers want 2 things: Dope artwork and dope storylines. There's no more artwork, so now all there is to take a shit on is the story. Why even make an official show if it isn't canon? This isn't fanfic. It's fucking Marvel.",1
A rat saved the universe,0
She's not according to Kevin Fiege. iMDb is basically Wikipedia,2

"I loved it too. It's so rare that comic book characters get to have an ending, instead of just  the adventure continues , so props to them for letting Cap retire gracefully.",0
"Yeah, I have to say I'm not too excited about the Eternals.  I feel like there are a number of other characters whose stories would be more interesting.",1
Not true.  I generally fast for 72 hours every 3 weeks and live.,1
Nnnneeeeeeerrrrrrrrdddddddddddssssssssss.,1
I remember he stood up for his fellow Avengers when they were getting paid significantly less. Dude sounds like he legitimately turned his life around and really became a hero on and off the set.,3
That's probably the most likely thing to convince me to try again. I don't know that I can slog through S3 though.,1
We need to boycott all future Spider-Man projects to drop the interest and value low enough so that Sony will sell it back to Marvel at a decent price and thus be able to give us the content we desire. Power of the purse!,1
Can we expect a new Saga after this (interconnected movies all pointing to a big conclusion down the line) or something different going forward?,1

"Hey Kevin really big fan of the MCU movies, watched all 22 of them before endgame. Just got one question in regards to the first captain movie: was there ever a version of the script where Steve actually learned how to fight using his trademark shield before getting insanely good at it? I ve always just found it so bizarre that the second Steve was injected with the super-soldier serum that Steve automatically became a BAMF using a shield just effortlessly taking out hydra agents",1

"Titan. I wasn't really a fan of that final battle in Endgame. To me, that battle lives and dies with that portal scene and the innital running at each other. None of the fights were as entertaining as what we saw on Titan.  The battle of Titan at least was something different to what we have seen before. It wasn't some massive CGI army vs. Avengers. It was Thanos with the gauntlet vs. Iron Man, Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and the Gaurdians.",2

It would be great to see him interact with and adapt a bit to some low level super villains with powers. There will always be regular criminals to content with too. ",1
"You really believe Horn didn't consult Feige on the decision at all? C'mon. I get that Feige has earned an enormous amount of goodwill from the fans because of his stewardship of the MCU, but the idea that he wasn't involved in the decision to fire Gunn stretches all credulity.",1

Either that or it touched on some personal subconscious issues you didn't know you have, but I really doubt that in this case. Edit after rewatch: it's the music",1

I would actually like to see something like that. Just as a side by side comparison of comics and real life.

It's such a clear indication that those people have nfi how Twitter works and just grasping on buzzwords,1
> Y'all just dismissing super fans... Wait what? I'm dismissing the posters who are dismissing this film as  virtue signaling  and  identity politics .,2
And Incredible Hulk had the worst casting by far,3
Classic avengers running picture ,1
"Pullin for you, man. I hope you get to see it before you leave. But I also hope you get better. So either way, sending tons of good vibes your way. ",1
"That's why they're up, from the B team. ",1
Pom s signature kinda infuriates me for some reason,1
"Good luck OP, I m sorry for your condition and it s amazing the number of people here moving every rock they can find to help you out!",1
That's not very pizza time of you,3
"Thank you, For the nice conversation",1
What about that year or so when he was bright blue and shit?,1
I'd have been pretty upset if Banner's  death  was played for comedy lol. I figured he was fine but good to have confirmation.,1
REEEE Larson,2
Now say  nuclear wessles! ,1
> SJW bullshit What?,2
All we need now is an Into the Spiderverse crossover in the MCU with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield.,2
I sincerely doubt they'd be stealing the idea from Reddit. It's not a hard connection to make. ,0
Holland is 20 something... ,3
What would you say are the biggest things the MCU needs to improve on from here on out?,1
Marvel could pull the biggest joke and have Thanos kill all the avangers in the end of the movie ,1
"I HAVE BEEN TEASED, TRAILER ",1
"So awesome! Really glad you got to live your dream, and keep up the good fight.",1
Not the most impactful trailer ever but I'm still excited for it. I think the score of the trailer was what was lacking imo. ,1
"Hi Mr Feige, thanks for some great movies you ve helped make!  Do you think if Dr. strange had mispronounced Doramamu (dora-mam-oo, or something like that) it would ve taken more or less time to win?  Thanks for your time!",1
Should have happened 5 years ago.,3
I can wait for Aunt May.,1
Why make you pay for one thing when they can make you pay for two things?,2
Huh didn t seem like that place had that many soldiers with full gear. I guess that makes sense.,1
Only when he got his hands on the greatest weapon ever forged from the guy who forged fucking Mjolner.,1
Im a freshly graduated advertising student from Michigan. How would I begin getting my foot in the door to advertise for movies? Its been a dream forever but it seems so far away.,1
He replaced  this (url) with this shit: >You smell good = >Did I not before?,1
"Jarvis, the butler who appears with Howard Stark briefly in Endgame, first appeared in the Agent Carter TV show.",2
You right.,1
"Yeah, still sitting in this damn safe house.",3
Absolutely agree. This surpasses any trailers from Star Wars. ,1
That s Awesome!!,1
I feel a kneed to cry now.,1
"Yes. It does. And player 1 is Mario, and player 2 is Luigi for some reason.",1
  bro u/lsdzeppelinn is basically having a conversation with themselves I'm dead,0
"Congrats but isn t maw for people who are dying,I don t know anything about maw so can you tell me what happened?",1
Or Thor travels there by other means. Rocket used worm holes in Vol2,3
So Tony obviously won t just be stuck in space the whole movie. His entrance to wherever the Avengers all meet up again is going to be some Thor arriving in Wakanda level shit.,1
That actress is pretty good in Preacher. You can only do so much with what you are given in Warcraft and Shield. ,1
"Rest in Peace, Stan.",1
It's Loki.,1
Thor sucked before ragnarok. Just way too bland and not much to like about him besides his muscles. Then you get the hulk involved and what does thor have? With the MCU they showed his powers and actually made him a true God. Some of Thors jokes suck but his action scenes kick ass,2
"That leak was bad. Like, really bad.",2
"At the same time, only Bradley Cooper actually exists in the MCU now, and he's just a voice. Disney's already cut them out of the movies with the snap, so if they start to be a big problem, Disney already has an out. ",3
"It's a boogeyman the right uses to insist that since they are affiliated with the objectively worst people in America, the left has an equivalent. Generally, though, it just means  someone who disagrees with me and isnt nice about it .",2

I do,2
But he was still a major plot device.  Mr. Stark I don't feel so good  and  I lost the kid  were seriously impactful.,1
"But once the Thanos story is done, will it take another 3 phases to wrap up the next mega boss supervillain?  Also, who will the next mega boss supervillain be?",1
"It's been floating around for a few days now and I've seen multiple people say they saw it on a rewatch. If it's faked, I'm completely stunned it hasn't been debunked yet.",3
Actually they had sex only 2 times. One time he was just  pleasuring himself and the load perfectly shoot through the door into the other room where his wife was.,3
"Oh, I thought all the helmets were the same, but I m loving that it s unique to her. ",2
"Happy isn't technically anything, he simply is in the MCU",1
"And I'm like boom, you looking for this?",1
"Then he was dying from poisoning in IM2 and making preparations for after his death. After surviving that, everyone thought he was dead for a while in IM3. Literally every movie he's been in, he's freaking out Pepper with his close encounters with death",3

I believe this is more iconic than  I hope they'll remember you     It just breaks my poor heart,3
"If it s anything like the Mandalorian, they won t be trying to take up too much of your time. It s been under 40 minutes and it s once a week for only 8 weeks. I ve had time to watch each episode twice and I have 2 kids under 3 and I bring work home.",1
Galactus you mean?,1
"Almost as if Reddit had all kinds of people. Crazy, right?",1
"They used the Stark time travel tech to return. Old Cap didn t use any sort of technology to be there. He said that instead of returning to 2023, he returned to the 40 s and got old with Peggy, knowing to be on that spot on that day for Tony s funeral. Problem is that he should have been in a whole new universe, a new 2023 that had included him in it for the past 80 years.",1
"Hello Kevin, thanks for doing this! With the introduction of the multiverse and the Fox deal, is there any discussion regarding a possible return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine at any capacity?",1
" dumbass sexist racists ... Keep up the narrative, bud. I'm sure that's why Wonder Woman did so well on RT and this didn't. Guess that one skipped over all the sexist racists radar, eh? Guess that's also why Alita: Battle Angel did so well with the audience too. Do you get paid to keep this clearly false narrative going?",0
Shuri was snapped?!?,1
"My father is total shithole, since I was teen I always thought I'll do things differently, I'll never make my child feel like shit. But now I feel like I'm also slowly becoming replica of my dad, I just hope I turn into good father",1

1. Avengers: Endgame 2. Avengers: Infinity War 3. Guardians Of The Galaxy  4. Thor: Ragnarok 5. CA: CW,1
" Whomever defeats my champion, shall earn their freedom I don't think dying is a stipulation. ",3
I feel like that's just win-win for everyone isn't it? They both get free publicity from each other's movies and basically the only potential snag is the risk of one of them churning out a stinker a la Spiderman 3 or the Andrew Garfield ones...which I think Sony has learned from anyway.,1
Yeah that s gonna make future movies kinda whack. All of the higher ups on earth are totally in friendly contact with all sorts of alien races through rocket nebula and capt marvel and realistically SHOULD have access to all sorts of alien tech on the consumer level after five years of this but nobody is going to ever talk about it lol,1
Anyone find is weird that the Hulk never made an appearance?  Or did I miss him somewhere? I saw banner but no hulk. ,1
"In a wide shot just before Cap goes back in time to return the stones to their original timelines, it looks like a helicopter is transporting something away like a crate or box. Any ideas as to what this might be?",3
"oooh no, I'm not upset at all. I was just kinda joking around, like  I will not let this trailer spoil the movie for me  ... bc I used to watch the trailers to these movies and would end up spoiling most of the best scenes. .",3
Thor:  YES!!! (https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111278558/6843482-thor+yes.gif),1

"Thats pretty good, but its taken. Wait, wait I got it, Doctor Octopus.",1
Who are some of the unspoken heros of the MCU that you believe deserve more credit?,1
It's crazy because it shows he just had one mission and then he was done. Like that's it. ,3
Stop I don t feel like crying right now :(,3
 Hope it s 3 hours long ,1
Go. To. Hhhhell!,3
That is unless she suggested using parts in the hope to save them both. Lat ditch attempt,1
"Oh, I just realized that the stars of Zodiac are Iron Man, Hulk and Mysterio. Am I the last guy on the internet to figure that out?",1
"I feel like phases one two and three are good story-wise but now it's just sort of useful for division and hype, less the story perspective (why am I writing like I'm drunk?)",1
Tony Stark in space. Soooo cool. So ready,1
Does the next villain have a human skin colour?,1
i think will get 1 maaaaybe 2 more movies with Professor Hulk before the change. it would feel to break neck to change him again.,2
"What's hilarious is that when you see the stunt women in those scenes and you look quick enough, when they do the stunts, they're often wearing flat versions of the same shoes.  That's why  this catwoman (https://2.bp.blogspot.com/eO03ItcFjI4iJbutvvBA1rOXZNEdIHaJ3uMQP4ryCMFK2Ogk1Mb AFYMz7j9DWqd4 tLuVq16rXX=s1600) is my favorite.  I don't doubt it for a second.  She has a costume for when she has to work the rooftops, and she has heels for when she has to work the men.",3
Idk I didn t watch it. I m just talking about trailers in general. They always give away key parts of films and I prefer to go in with little to no knowledge,1
Excuse you literally nothing could ever top  celery man (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maAFcEU6atk),3
"I feel like when a film is entertaining on the surface, people just don't feel a need to look deeper than that. Civil War, for example, was an excellent exploration of themes of revenge and responsibility, figuratively deconstructing the concept of vengeance while literally deconstructing the Avengers.",1
I certainly hope he gets to see it early!  avengers4alexander,1
"We get the fucking helmet, we are getting everything we ever wanted and more",3
"Since they'll almost certainly bring some iteration of Wolverine back in the near future, I'm very curious who the hell will replace Jackman, given his firm statement of not returning to the role. I thought Jackman did a great job, particularly as the films matured and he grew (literally and dramatically) into the part, but I won't deny that the comic purist in me always wanted a true to form Wolverine - 5'3, gruff, hairy little heap of muscle and rage.",1

"Yes! Brilliant, brilliant at casting!  I never really thought of the casting as terribly important compared to writing, directing, etc, ... she changed my mind by basically building the whole MCU.",1
Dark themes don't trigger an R rating.,1
"If anything they'd add padding to his costume, a lot cheaper and doesn't take as much time to get it to look ok.",1
"Hi Kevin, did you finally get to take a vacation after Endgame?",1
He's gonna have so much fun with fat Thor. I can't wait to see it!,1
Would ve made more sense if it was during the end game,3
We'll miss you Cap'n  ,1
The one on the left looks cooler The one on the right is just a trench coat with a corset,1
I think it s actually completely valid in business. Especially since Disney made the movie. It s similar to taking all the glory on a group project that you didn t even work on aside from thinking of the topic for the project.,1
I'm just glad to know they got ant-man out some how. I missed the release of ant-man and the wasp and only saw it on Netflix like last week so seeing the end of it had me a little shocked and caught off guard,1
That explains the Incredible Hulk...,0
DISNEY: we are going to fire James Gunn MARVEL: BUT NOT US DISNEY: we own you MARVEL:Give drax what he wants!  https://youtu.be/nzobsJyLiqM ,1

Thor 2:  Electric Boogaloo,2
Assuming hes actually there.....remember....Hulk was present in the IW trailer.,1
But caiptain marvel isn't black,0
Not surprised.  Disney loves pedos.,0
"I love the hate/spite in his face when he snaps, it's like one last  fuck you  to Thanos.",1
"Okay but, big giant franchise property being the highest grossing film of all time is vastly less interesting than an original IP becoming the highest grossing film.",0
What did he do ? ,1
"No, its 2 movies for now because nobody in their right mind is going to agree to anything more before we see how the movies perform. If both companies like the deal, they will continue. They are using Holland in Sony films, so we will see him in more movies beyond these 2 already",1

The one next to the first photoshopped man really looks like Ross from FRIENDS,1
I feel like the Fox people should keep that...,1
Thanos is no fun to play w in Marvel vs Capcom 2,2
>Herbie. The FF robot/ai After playing Borderlands 3 I'd be on-board with Ice-T voicing Herbie.,1
Pretty sure that's the point. People will look for a reason why the shot is there and they will come across an explanation. That is a way more fun way to tell the audiences the villains are shapeshifters than just showing it.,2
I'm here for Chris Evans in that plaid shirt. Love me some good looking Cap,3
Y all should watch that video of Michael Shannon reading a sorority letter. It s hilarious,1
Many of the Marvel movies are. Most of the pre-Russo era.,1
She clearly did a great job!,1
Masturbatory? Seems like you really enjoyed the film then :),2
"To be fair,most of his movies were films he had to make because of financial troubles he had through his career.",1
The only other thing that comes close is CA swearing. Thors transformation has been radical.,0
Who said that was Cap's last hug? He is still alive at the end of Endgame.,1

I mean it took how many build up movies...,1
Every time I saw his name in a headline I feared that the news was about his death... and after so many years I was sure he'll never die :(,1
Why was the ending fight scene in Endgame horrible? Someone should have stopped that pandering.,0
They don't want people binging the entire series because weekly will lead into other shows and eventually into the movies.   I'd like to think that they've planned everything out so these characters can enter the MCU movies.,1
I remember on the farm he had wraps on his feet,1
A little later Thanos is read his Miranda Rights...,1
"Thank you for the steady hand at the wheel, the consistency, and giving everyone else in the field an ideal to strive towards.  How do you feel about Whedon writing out Quicksilver that quickly, and if he hadn't been, how could he have affected the later films?",1

Nasty. Just my opinion we all got our fetishes.,0

"I hate reading comments where people don't know obvious things, don't you?",0
Why do you have to be such an angry fanboy? I m voicing my opinion. If you can t handle opposing viewpoints maybe the internet isn t the place for you. Either way hope you have a great day :),1
What about vision?,1
Thanos farm du du dudu dudu I blame Grandayy ,2
What??? Daredevil got cancelled? Wtf?! ,1
"Okay, what's up with these old people rallying against superheroes lately?",0
Yeah if they would've based Ultron on Hank Pym like in comics it would've worked.,1
It's like OLED vs SONY,1
Will iron man come back?,1
What if kink shaming is my kink?,2

"His tweets were very inappropriate but occurred over 10 years ago.. and he has shown himself to be changed from those days and shows gratitude. Rosanne, her tweets were recent and she doesn t show herself to be genuine or having any gratitude. Instead, she makes herself out to be a victim. But in time with some personal growth I would think she will deserve another chance too, I just don t think she is there yet. ",1
I fucking hate this change so much.,3
 So anyway I start slashin ,3
"Na that's bullshit though, NO WAY is the suit stronger than Hulk. It should've disintegrated way before Tony had the chance to speak, but I still enjoyed the film. Just nitpicking the details. Like how Tony can fight thanos with multiple stones in IW but Thor gets TRASHED by Thanos with only one.",1
I have a feeling its just how they will negotiate from now on.  1 film each side per deal. Sony will use the same character on the side,1
"Uh, yeah",0
"Good luck OP, it's a hell of a thing cancer i truly hope you get to experience Endgame somehow. Can i ask a question though, it's completely understandable if you don't want to answer. How did you find out you'd gotten cancer? Was it just a doctors appointment that turned awful or did you notice obvious changes.",2
I thought the portals were because of the convergence.  As the convergence gets closer the portals become worse.,3
Groot makes way more merch money than Rocket and they killed him,1
"And (my impression is) people mostly consider those two and IW the strongest films to come out of MCU.  I guess it would be stale if every film was like that, but changing up plot arcs and expectations is such a good move for them.",2
Yes! Fuck yes!,1

"We've all been dreading this day for a while now, and it still feels a little surreal... He did an interview recently that made it pretty clear that his time was coming, and he was ready for it. He has missed his wife dearly and I'll be taking comfort knowing that they are together again. ",0

Why didnt the old lady just offer one of those strawberry candies,1
I don t know... we might not need one every two years. But it would be a shame not to see their upcoming animated slate.,1
Hell yeah!  I do like the dark order character that has the stick with three points close together that was on the left of Loki.  Looks the same as in Ragnarok about fighting three vampires that are huddled together.,1
YASSSSSSSSS HES BAACK IN THE MCUUU,1
"I agree. I consider TDW  not good, but not bad either .",1
So you just Vape In there?,1
Does anyone know if there will be Spiderman 4? or Spiderman 3 is the last one? Is there any rumour about Spiderman 4?,1
Kevin and Angela are the best. Jim looks unironically awesome.,1
Best guess would be he is with doctor strange and spidey. But there is a shot of hulk buster Armor landing in Wakanda which could be before this fight.,1
"Thank you for creating the MCU! What you have done has been amazing Btw, how long 'till we see the x-men and/or fantastic 4 in the mcu?",2
I don't know that Ashley Johnson will be coming back considering it was Joss Whedon who had her as a future love interest to Cap. I'd love to be wrong and have someone else bring her back into the MCU as she's a good actress.,1
And only a Cap fan has enough patience to hear your whining about Cap fans.,3
Thank God! I was SO disappointed when I heard they were having troubles. Especially after how good Far From Home was! Yesssssss!,1
"Hmm, I kinda wish this made it into the movie but I guess it was either this or the funeral scene. The funeral was amazing imo so I'm happy.",2

"I came on here looking for hype for the coming trailer only to see it had dropped a half hour before, glad as well to not have had it spoiled for me ",1
"The comparison kinda balances out though, because at that time higher priced premium formats like Dolby, RPX, Dbox etc. either didn't exist or weren't very widespread.",1
"I mean, Thanos wasn t wrong.",1
"Had Rocket, Nebula, Stark, Scott and Banner all turned to dust... Strange would have gotten the heroes from Titan back to Earth but none of them would have ever invented the time machine and without Rocket   Nebula the heroes wouldn't be able to reach even the 'first stage' of endgame where they kill Thanos since they'll never find him in the first place without Rocket rigging the satellites to track the energy surge and Nebula knowing his 'retirement plans'.",2
He's an immigrant to Canada. He's actually an Englishman.,1
"This, this does put a smile on my face.",2
The best part about putting a tag at the end of a movie is so the audience can sit through the entire end crawl and read all the names of the amazing people who make the MCU what it is.,3
Torrenting is already a situation where you don't get immediate gratification.  So a slow download isn't that bad.  I still pull 5mbps on popular torrents.  If I gave a shit about speeds I'd lease a seedbox and just do a direct download at my leisure.,1
"I'm glad this letter supports James Gunn as a person and not for what he said, and I'm glad to see some more positivity in the comments because the Instagram comment section on that post was harsh. I dont defend James's actions or take part on the actions that happen from here on out. While this comment cant be 100  neutral in everyone's eyes I hope everyone sees what I am trying to say",1
"That's his plan all along, starting with those tweets 10 years ago. Real mastermind there, haha  ",1
"Hi Kevin, Im Chinese and a big fan of the MCU. Can I get a role in the upcoming Shangchi Movie???",1
I mean film is a visual medium. Does that scene where he steps on the broken portrait of his own face before looking up at that big fresco painting of his dad at his most horrific not signify anything? Because the movie certainly seemed to think it did.,1

"You could argue that, I think they did great with piecing*  the film together, kinda prefer the Nebula ending tho just like from the comic books, that would ve been a great final battle twist having to go from fighting the Mad Titan, to fighting your ally who was just fighting with you, who just discovered uncontrollable power",1

Maybe they didn't? I dont think looking through past tweets is the common protocol when hiring a new director... And it is whataboutism because your arguement of why Gunn should stay on is because Disney used to do crass stuff decades ago. That is literally the definition of whataboutism.,0
I think Josh Brolin will reprise as Cable. I'm waiting for Bob to return and revealing himself as an agent of Hydra,1
I didn t even need to see the scene.  The music was already too much for me and I started to cry.,1
As much as I like marvel movies I don't see a single one becoming a classic. I say marvel and not superhero because there are actually good superhero movies that aren't only about eye-candy sfx.,1

"Friday is a reference to Robinson Crusoe. Friday was the name of an indigenous man he meets on the island, and he's kind of the sidekick/servant to Robinson.

Did you see the film... at all? Dr Strange saw every timeline,0
You know when I watched Endgame and everyone  came trough the portals I had this feeling of happiness like I never had I wanted to stay up and cry and shout as loud as I can and I never had this feeling until I saw this video.  This is for my the best video in the entire internet. Thank you so much.,1

"Simply incredible watching Thanos slam Spidey to the ground with that haunting tune in that background. Three years ago, I'd have never ever imagined this possibility. Where tf was Hawkeye and Ant-Man? I know Hawkeye is going to be in the film, but there has been no sign of Ant-Man in any promotional art for Avengers 3. Does he have a small role in this film because of Ant-Man and the Wasp? I know for a fact that he will have a bigger role in Avengers 4 with the addition of Wasp and Captain Marvel. ",1
IF you had to do the DC universe arc what would the story have been? What would have been your DC infinity war moment?,1

Good camera work is everything. That and some platforms. Perspective in movies is typically very intentional and important,2
"I have a lot of respect for Pratt after this. He had to have known the storm this would cause for him, maybe moreso than anyone else in the cast. ",2
Actually that's all in the camera angle! Setting where the horizon is on your shot can affect how tall your character looks quite a bit. If they had put it higher  up on the screen he would look smaller and vice versa. :),3

Yep! Disney is already making bank on the Spider-Man merchandising but now will get 25  of the box office profit on top of that. I think Sony really wants Venom to be in the MCU and I think a Maximum Carnage movie set in the MCU is a real possibility if this deal works.,3
We won Mr Stark.,1
That time when you drop a random fact and due to the situation you become a massive asshole. Just my type of oversight my dude.,3
"This would be so painfully unfulfilling. I don't want the movies to turn into the comics (with regards to death) and I don't want to see the Time Stone get used like the Dragon Balls. It also neuters Thanos and renders any destruction and damage he causes - and, by extension, our time spent watching the first movie - moot. I'll be pretty friggin' disappointed if they use the Time Stone to undo all of the  bad stuff .",3

I did the same thing. My excitement was thru the roof during the entire battle.,1
"That would be abysmally poor writing to cheaply kill everyone off in this movie and then just go  lol nothing matters  in the next one.  I guess it's normal in comics that nobody dies for real, but the MCU hasn't done much of that, and I hope it doesn't decide to start.",1

I love Tom Holland, he is my favourite spiderman and anything the MCU has done thus far feels so right and epic and special, but I know people that loved the amazing spiderman as well so you are not alone on that.",1
He was doing other projects so probably just recorded the lines for Infinity war.,0
I'm gonna assume this takes place a few years after IW. No way the world isn't practically apocalyptic after losing HALF of its population.,1

"I apologize for the confusion. I saw that statement a few times on this thread, wasn't sure if it was true, and thought it the most important part of the point you were trying to make. I assumed this was where you had read it. Sorry for that.",0

They're deleted for a reason,2
"This is not true. Forbes (one of the most reputable publications there is) states that if Sony is sold, acquired, etc, they lose the rights, as per their original contract from decades ago. This has not changed because agreeing to alter that stipulation would be one of the stupidest blunders marvel or Disney could ever possibly make, and would be for no reason.",1

"F. I never stop telling young people that Stan Lee never knew success until he was in his 40's. All other commentary aside, this something to remember and hold onto when you feel like life is over and you have to accept the hand you're dealt.",1

Can t find them sorry,0
It seem you are really stupid trying to compare these 2. Its a total different movies. Dont try to compare a titanic with some comics flicks. How can you compare these two is beyond ridiculous. If a ship sank how can they continue unlike MCU? Its easy to make sequels on comics stuff. i can tell you there is alot of movies sequels that made more money than the first one. So its just not MCU   Star Wars,1
Not funny,0
Hello Mr. Feige I love what you've done with the MCU. I was wondering which movie was the hardest to make? I was also wondering what your favorite MCU movie and comic book is?,1
"Considering this deal seems to just be for two more movies (one Spider-Man one and one other one), plus the  cross ing  cinematic universes  comment, it seems like the deal is probably just to give him a proper send-off in the MCU before making some kind of official multiverse connection with Sony's universe and letting him go over there from then on.",1

Where is Ant-man though? Is he in this?,1
"That s awesome! Great cosplay, keep it up!",1
"Hey Kevin, what are your thoughts on the Venomverse? Is the multi-dimension tease for FFH a nod/explanation so that the MCU can possibly bring in Symbiotes on their own? Because I think the hypest movie would be a black suit spider-man vs sinister 6. Oh man that would be great",1
LMFAO best joke I've heard in ages. Some of y'all are really delusional,1
"It wouldn t be a dismissal because they wouldn t have hired them in the first place. If he was tweeting stuff like that a month ago, the firing would be perfectly reasonable. It s not reasonable to hire him when Disney absolutely knew about this then turn around and fire him. ",2
That better be about Budapest,3
"Eh, the shows are also going to take longer to film than the movies are. For actors like Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, etc who don't the biggest part in any of the movies maybe that's an attractive job to take. But actors like Boseman, Cumberbath, or Larson who are pulling serious double-duty leading their own movies and being the biggest part of the crossovers probably don't want to add an extra project on top of those things.",3

Well it was just an example. There's more of those kinds of videos. But you're welcome!,1
It still works phonetically,1
"Yeah, the same happened to me.  I'm not usually a fan of heavily stylized art but I love Darwyn's art. Probably my favorite cb artist at the moment and New Frontier is such a beautiful love letter to DC Comics.  Have you read Batman/The Spirit ? it's great!",1
"Thanos has already fulfilled his life goal of eliminating half of the population. So, what is he up to these days? Does he still aim to kill more lives?

"My bad but that's where I'm confused, if the snap happened right after Ragnarok shouldn't the snap have happened in 2017, so 5 years later it's 2022?",1
Fav shot has to be Tony and Nebula working on who knows what. I'm really hoping after Tony records his message that he just stares into space with his arm on the window and after a couple seconds is just like  This isn't how I die  and we get an Iron Man 1 cave scene.,1
Yes. Please an AoS reference!,1
I can't wait till 2021,1
I think we found the ONE person in the world who'll skip Avengers because the trailer isn't up to his or her standards.,1
I don't think you really got the scene...it is ALL about Natasha's sacrafice.,3
 what you don't realize in the trailer is that Captain America is really mad and wants to reverse what Thanos did in the previous film ,2
I was just going to say something similar. This would be a really cool way to show her origin while not making that her focus. ,3
"Given that she isn't a very well known character to non-comic book people, letting the audience figure out who she is at the same speed as herself seems like a pretty good framing device for the movie.",2
"Regardless, any part of her that *is* biological is going to need water and calories to function / live.",2
I guess we ll see. It ll definitely be my least favorite part of the movie if they bring his ass back for like the third time. ,0
I'm old. I know none of these people. I would feel like an idiot when they revealed themselves.,1
"It's not like the article bashed them or anything, so I don't see how it didn't age well. They stated a fact: Marvel rolled the dice on two unknowns at the time and it worked in their favor",1
So nice to meet n-ooooooh,1
"Just to be clear, that saying is older than Marvel in real life.  Mine is: A thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. ",1
"Because all the promo material until now had him in this bro-tank. And so seeing Thanos all geared up and doing more than sitting on a space chair is exciting. So yes, we've seen it but not in is full glory. The trailer gets us one step closer to it. ",2
What is this a crossover episode?,2
"We saw a Black Knight Easter egg in Antman and the Wasp, but was it intended to be Sir Percy, Nathan Garrett or Dane Whitman? Also on a more personal note, I was able to meet Stan Lee once a few years but was too nervous to say anything more than  Thank you  so, thank you Mr. Feige. The MCU is one of the main things my dad and I continue to bond over. Thank you very much, and I'm greatly looking forward to Far From Home and the next phase of the MCU",1

"I do not want to live in a society were people are moving from one public shaming to the next, always trying to drudge up the past to destroy others. What the fuck kind of world is this?

Well said. Andrew Garfield.. yikes,1
Its kind of hard to do a proper Hulk as long as Universal is not willing to play ball. If only they took a long at how Sony is handling Spider-man.,3

"Thanos was an Eternal and essentially a demigod beyond even the power of the Asgardians.  He isn't depicted in the movies, but he was far more powerful than any of the Marvel heroes to begin with except maybe Scarlet Witch (House of M, anyone?).

The films and the connections you have helped to create are beyond amazing and truly a dream come true in every way.,1
Yes!!! So glad that it won. ,3
True-ish,3
Not at all! People have different interests. It s definitely weird that you just decided to tell people that though. Especially on a sub that s dedicated to Marvel movies. Most people would just choose not to comment at all if they re not interested.,2

"That's no easy feat, so I'm very proud of you for kicking its ass.",3
Why do say that? I m of the opinion that it is the best Thor film by a wide margin.,1
It's still a wild leap to assume they are dead. Why wouldn't they be showing others who we KNOW are dead? Suri was confirmed to survive the snap along with her mother. Wakandans have spent a lifetime in hiding and Black Panther begins with Nakia undercover. A much reasonable assumption is that they are in hiding and Bruce is looking at panels of people they are searching for who could be of assistance.,3
"Don t worry. If he does, he ll walk it off.",3
Because have you seen Black Panther? They're the good guys,1
"Hi Kevin, Are you interested in doing anything with any Sony characters in the future? Like purchasing some? Or do they really want to hold onto them? Also, who is your personal favourite hero and villain? P.S. I absolutely love what you have achieved with Marvel",1
I would have loved a scene where the surviving original Avengers members lift Tony s body or his coffin or something into their shoulders and carried him off (similar to Cap carrying his old love after her passing in Civil War). That would have broken me emotionally but I think it would have been a beautiful scene,1
I'm honestly disappointed in that. I would rather get a solid Akira. :/,1
Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange to you young man.,1
But they are posters are if he's an actor?,1
He doesn t have to want to be apart of the Fantastic Four. His relationship with them is his main comic relationship with other heroes and it is not about him wanting to join them in anyway.  There s no comic storylines of Spidey anything like what they did in the MCU with Peter and Tony.,2
"lol, yup. In the comics it's definitely not portrayed as  good , though its motives are pretty mysterious most of the time.",2

"I doubt it. The movie's horror tone will come from weird imagery (like the first film) and some jumpy/scary scenes, kind of like a less bloody *It*. There probably won't be an excess of vulgar language or anything too violent or disturbing. *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom* also invoked a lot of horror film tropes, especially in the second half when they're in the mansion, and it still got a 12 here in the UK.",2

Hijacking your comment to say a character taking a specific decision instead of another is by definition not a plot hole. A majority of people don t even know what a plot hole really is. Source: One of John August s Screenwriting Podcast episodes,3
But Ant-Man was in the quantum realm   Spider-Man was on Titan at the time of the snap. Of course no one knew where they were. But Shuri was in Wakanda the entire time. It wouldn t make sense for her to be missing if she didn t die,3

"Every actor has a bad movie, and with Gunn the focus any criticisms that GotG 3 may receive would almost certainly be attributed to his removal.

Np :),1
And he could claim that Spider-Man called him to  silence him .,1
Ants,3
No. He just takes the stones out of his gauntlet when he takes it off. Simple. Thor 3 ends with Thanos reaching Thor's ship. It makes the most sense to start out IW from there. It gets the balls rolling with other plots sooner. Hulk is clearly zapped into Doctor Strange's place using the Space Gem most likely by Loki. Space Stone-> Power Stone -> Reality Stone(he doesn't have it so he probably fails here) -> goes for Earth's stones  ,1

"It's even better because they're always talking about how they  don't trade lives . In this case, Doctor Strange had no choice but to trade.",1
Chris Pratt beats his kids?,1
Needs more shilling and  i clapped!! ,1
"Was there ever a point at which it looked like the MCU wouldn't make it to Endgame?  If so, when was that? If not, what would it have taken to see the house collapse, or was it always,  Damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead?",1
What about the pg 13 deadpool movie?,1
how old is wanda maximoff really,1
Oh yeah that's right. There was a lot going on in those few minutes. I need to see it again.,2
Happened to glance at my phone while sitting at my desk at work... may have squealed... people may have heard.  But it was worth it.,1
"Hey Kevin,  How did you think the MCU was going to turn out and could you have ever imagined it would get as grandiose as it has?",1
"Ey man, we're about to hop on this ship and get out of here. You wanna join?",3
Nice catch I didn t!! Every detail is a damn mistery and i love it,2
"I'm tired of the avengers, why can't they make a hulk movie ",0
He d be too OP,3
Holy shit this is awesome,1
He was still Hulk but that wouldn't mean Banner was dead. He thought that the Hulk personality would become the dominant persona and Hulk would never let Banner out again. ,3
"u/Joe-Russo   u/anthony-russo   u/Marvel-Official   Russos, I ve come to bargain ",2
I'm more bothered about the slight truth in your statement. ,1
"Apparently his newfound confidence is supposed to mean their personalities merged, but yeah, that s bs",2
"I want to watch this so bad, but I think I'm going to pass and try to watch the movie without recognizing a single scene from this trailer. I'm sure I'm going to miss out on some sick memes that people are going to make, so this may be good bye for a while r/marvelstudios. ",1
and those people saying that would be downvoted too.,1
"I'm not casual, and I didn't notice this one, imagine people that are casual haha.",3

"Who's hotter? Both. But, the chance of instant death makes Hela a tad more exciting.  ",1

I'd be curious if they touch on the real mandarin in the master of kung-fu movie.   I really hated what they did with the mandarin until I saw hail to the king.,3
"I think they will show a lot of unused footage in future movies, like how they're going to use unused footage from Civil war in the Black Widow movie. We will eventually, sometime, see Hulk vs banner confrontation.",1

"Die mad about it maybe? Reality isn t often full of positivity, glitter, and rainbows.",0
"I am so tempted to watch it. But, I commit to go dark this time. I want to feel the same thing as watch the first Avengers movie.",1
Movie detalles is gonna have to mention this somehow,1
"He's some  kind of demon, right?",1
shipping,0
"With Stan gone, would you want to fill in for the movie cameo's?",1
"The blame can't just go on Marvel then. Before heroes there were Transformers, and before that other blockbuster film series. Truth is there isn't a lot of new film ideas that can be done.",1
Bringing AoS (or the Netflix heroes) into the movies would confuse people who only watch the movies. Bringing the movie heroes to TV would be expensive. ,0
I really like the idea of setting up Nova through Thanos wrecking Xandar.  ,1
But im commuting on the train >. ,2
Who is the secretly gay character in MCU?,1
"I listened to that episode of WTF the other day. Was a great interview. Brolin and Maron definitely come across as a couple of old boys, but some good ol boys.",2
Oh so the thing that isn t really apart of the MCU but delusional fans wished it was,0
this is how i fly in my dreams and have an axe pull me off.,3

How do you think those movies would have diverged if Joss Whedon directed them both?,3
I thought that streamed movies at 1080p is always at a slightly lower quality than a bluray? Not really that noticeable but it still there.,3

"well he beat the shit outta thor, tony and cap at the same time. beat thor with both of his hammers and broke caps vibro shield easily, beat tony real quick. i guess the only ones he had trouble with were wanda and carol, but mostly wanda",2
They're both pictures of a person...,1
"Marvel has done such a great job making these heroes relatable and personable. Captain America was my least favorite comic book hero. I never would have thought a Cap movie would be my favorite (Winter Soldier). I was 100  ready to pass on Ant Man. Then they got Paul Rudd, and he's just the best. Huge props ",2
"They won t grab him, marvel grabs lesser known directors for various reasons.",1
Thank you very much!  ,3
Congrats bud! My moms been off treatment for 7 months too. Keep up the good fight!,1
"I've been to a handful of ACE shows to buy autographs and by my estimate, he's put at least  4200 into signatures alone",1
Considering they all got canceled right before marvel streaming service launched  . Makes me think their new home is there.,1
"The reason some people are doubtful is because it's only gone one way (until Jarvis showed up in Endgame). It's obvious the movies are canon to the shows, but whether the shows matter to the movies is a different story.",3
Came here for this,3
"Really? I loved GotG2. It's probably my favorite marvel movie. I can't think of a time they ruin an emotional moment with a quirky one liner or something like that. I mean they do have a lot of it, but it kinda fits with the characters and their flaws. I guess the Drax  completely still  scene is kind of out of place but idk, that just seems natural to me for someone whose race takes everything literal (and seemingly has a poor sense of humor).",1
"Yeah, although I like Ego, but that's mainly do to with how Kurt Russell plays him and I'm really interested in the mythology of the Celestials.",2
"My guess would be Fantastic Four with the Disney+Fox deal. There's enough oomph for a whole new phase of movies in there, and a new big baddy with Dr Doom and Galactus.",1
"That last scene with the suits feels perfect for Marvel to edit the fuck out to remove any spoilers. Where s Carol, and Thor, and Banner? Maybe in the movie we will see someone else or maybe someone isnt actually there... ",1
You didn t? That s weird.,0
>* Yoyos >* Slap bands >* Slinkies >* Tamagotchis >*  Scrunchies >*  Bike shorts I had all of these things in middle school. I'm only 21.,2
"Yeah, that's kinda like me tbh, I really like Holland's portrayal but I feel like Watts has no clue what he's doing with the character and is completely ruining Spider-Man. Hopefully the Russo's rehabilitate Peter a bit in Avengers 3 and 4.",1
That's how the hivemind works.,1
Spoiler that comment!,1
Kick ass.  Hopefully you encounter no further issues from your treatments and condition aside from not having to deal with it again or gaining superpowers.,1
Surprised they didn't play Garbage or Nirvana during the trailer.  x200B Maybe for the next one? ,3
Like war machine!  Lol,1
"See exhibit A.... Legion. God damn that show is an artistic masterpiece. (I know it's not relative to the MCU, just using it as an example)",1

This guy deserves all the upvotes/ awards because this was just...,1
"I respectively disagree with you, but your response is really well put together and I absolutely see where you are coming from. I knew Trump wasn t the best example (exactly for the reason you posted) but I still stand by the irony that this outrage is the Frankenstein s Monster created by the same group of people who don t like where it led them this time around. Best of luck to you.",1

I wasn t a big fan of him but this isn t a bad idea!,1

"Not a good trailer, looks like Thor 1. I loved that they brought Brie Larsn for the role, she's a good actress, still young and hot, but she doesn't sound like Carol in the trailer, sure, it's just some lines in the trailer, but anyway, I hope the next trailer is better.",1

Wait....I think I know why he isn't impressed....,1
"Yeah, but that particular speech wasn't stupid",1
"I'm ready for this. I would like to know what happened to Howard the duck? Did the snap get him, did Thanos get him when going to the collector, or is he out enjoying a Martini somewhere? ",1
 So you re just going to disrespect the creator of imgur like that,1
Maybe it's for promotional or something,1
Not a whole lot of options for them to choose from.  This seems like a silly thing to be pessimistic about. ,1
"Yeah. Seems like poor editing. In the words of Tony Stark,  Not a great plan. ",3
I thought we were comparing feats between gamora and cap though? The way I saw it is Thanos initially underestimated caps strength and then slowly dialed it up and Cap continued to resist.  At first Thanos looks curious and then he begins to grow impatient.  I imagine his other hand is going to give cap a good punch or someone else is going to intervene.,1
Or just post anything about Goose,1
Man that twist in his comment really made me sad. ,3
Why didn't he do this in endgame,1
Well GOG is set years before the current MCU ,1

There d be no difference since half the team is on the DL anyway,3
Look at this dude pretending surprise naval ballista strikes from behind a rock aren't a totally normal and logical thing.,1
Congratulations you've been hired at cinemasins.,1
They would not have needed all of them there at the same time/place.  They're both amazing scenes that hit hard but Theoden arriving and making that speech was fucking timeless.  We'll need another 10 or so years worth of rewatches before we'll know if it stands the test of time like LOTR did.,3
"People who liked the movie, a.k.a. everyone except the incels who were scared of a girl superhero",2
I truly don t think I ll ever stop enjoying saying Thor 4.,2
Okay ngl that s actually a good fancast,3
I wonder how many phases does this general plan extends to,2
I want to see a scene where Tony is asking Nebula to hand him tools while he fixes the ship then we see that the tools are from Nebula's body lol,3
Ok legit tho. What if at the end of endgame they can't defeat thanos so they leave to a different universe within the multiverse and the rest of the movies take place in a separate universe within the marvel multiverse?,0

That baby is gonna grow up and realize later on that he met Spider-Man. Amazing!,1
"Jesus, is that really all Heimskr dialogue? That's more than most main characters",1
The fact that you use that word as a go-to derogatory word is really worrying. But I suppose that's about to be expected from a manchildre that's the target audience for superheroes garbage.,0
it was bland and generic - the MCU's version of Suicide Squad  imo,0

Still waiting on that list.,1
Thank you! First thing I thought of. The looks of Tag and the job perks of Chip. ,1

"Hey there, Kevin! Since the multiverse is being brought up in the upcoming Spiderman film, hear this out. IF we we're in an alternate universe, with you still president of Marvel Studios.

Not many puns left thanks to you spider- pigs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BARjPuUN36Y feature=youtu.be t=24),3
"If he could blow up spaceships we've never seen it. He didn't unlock the full potential of his lightning until Ragnarok and he had to take on the force of a star to help create Stormbreaker which can summon the bifrost. Thor has evolved and been upgraded through the movies. And idk how else to explain it, but the rules that his powers revolve around make sense. The god stuff is fun. What i mean is Captain Marvel is pretty generic atm with the flying and shooting lasers out of her hands.",2

"The first two acts were good.  The last act was incredibly rushed and hand-wavy, with almost no releases for dramatic tensions built in the first two acts.  I still think it was worth watching and enjoyed it more than I didn't, but it had some serious issues.",1
You rock!! That s awesome!!!!!!! You ve just made my day!!!,1
Thanks a lot guy.  Guess I don't even need to see it.,2
"I agree on every point. I never even saw your post, but mine is in lockstep with yours. I was excited when Gunn was removed from the film. The entirety of GotG 2 felt masturbatory to me. Gunn definitely needed reigning in.",0
I always heard the term that bad publicity is still good publicity. I am glad to see that Hollywood can be forgiving too. ,1
"Yes. I know. Big fan. And his must recent projects have been fantastic as well, especially the movie he's doing with his cousin, Robbie. I just think he'd be a great fit for the role.",1
Cool chilled Hawkeye before snap...now pissed AF!!,1
What do you do there?,1
Taking bets on who karks it in this one,1
A guy with a bow and arrow and a guy who is shrinks got the hype spots in the most anticipated trailer of the year. What a time to be alive. Let's go Scott! ,1
"It would really surprise me if that would change anything. Disney already executed Gunn, they are not bringing him back.",1
Sheesh,1

"Endgame allowed us to revisit moments and characters from previous films, and it was so wonderful to see people like Robert Redford and Rene Russo again. Who else would you have liked to bring back, if there was a way for it to fit the story?",1

Was that Bruce Banner in the Sanctum Sanctorum? Does this mean we're gonna get Dr Stange Vs Hulk?,1
Also waited for Asgard to be weak,1
"Let's be real though, a live action Akira will more than likely go the way of Ghost in The Shell or Avatar. Thor is a sure thing, ESPECIALLY with Taika.",1

This needs to be top comment. Show em we really want a long cut ,2
I have seen literally zero negative comments on the mohawk,3
The production of that movie was so fascinating,1
"Honestly didn't put much thought into it.   got snapped  was just shorthand or a mental autocorrect for both of them being separate from the rest of the world, specifically cap, and therefore not able to talk to him about spiderman.",1

Ha! I understood that reference. Dick Grayson is wise beyond his years.,1
They will try because its being cracked down on. Even TED Talk had to take down a video normalizing pedophilia. It's disgusting. ,0
"Hi Kevin! Hypothetically speaking, if the Sony deal had gone through earlier than it did, do you think Spider-Man's introduction to the MCU would have been different? Thanks!",1
"Congrats on the wish and glad to hear you are getting better, Marvel and DC both love their fans that is one thing they both go out of their way to show and do ....maybe one day i will get to meet spiderman but i do not think he could web sling real well in kansas suburbs lol!",1
And they say it get colder,2
"They show this at the end of the last avengers movie, with planes falling out of the skies. If you ever read Steven King's Cell, I imagine it's something like the intro to that book.  Way more people died to the ensuing chaos and accidents than the actual disaster.",3
And Briellion keeps marching on,3
"Yeah they originally had Hiddleston show himself to Thor doing an Anthony Hopkins impersonation, to hint the fact that Loki is masquerading as Odin",1
"If I was RDJ, I'd sign it, only after you got everyone else, and then do it with my left hand, just so no one would believe you.",3

Say spoiler at least!  YOU FKIN RETARD!,0
It doesn t even look like Thor has a suit on. It looks like Hemsworth is actually fat,1
"My guess is that during S7 they will jump between different years and finally end up in the main timeline, either in the 5 year gap, or during Endgame. Maybe they do something inside Thanos's ship or something",1
Why wouldn't they?  Turn it around any other way and you'd have the same response.  Or are we supposed to accept actual racist remarks and be fine with it?  I don't think so.,0
do you have a source to back that up?,0
"Is that a Skrull on the table at the 38 second mark, when Fury says  space invasion... ?",1
THIS is how u build a cinematic universe DC. There were lines in this trailer from 5 years ago in the original Avengers,2
"The government is not going to pay millions of dollars for an ex con. There's just no way. The median rent for a one bedroom apartment is almost  3700 a month, can you just imagine how much this 4 - 5 bedroom house is pretty month? There's just no way",3
"I dont even care if they make him not Ant-Man anymore, I just want Paul Rudd to keep being Scott Lang and somehow getting involved in other peoples lives. Also Luis and the rest of the crew would be ideal as well.",1
It s Cap,1
Stop kink shaming him.,2
How do you decide what characters get a movie?,2
Well this cosplay just got even better.,1
"It s why the CGI was particular bad for Banner in the Hulkbuster suit compared to literally everything else in the movie. It s funny how so many MCU diehard fanboys still refuse to admit that it was bad cgi, cause then IW wouldn t be  perfect .",3
Maybe the original x men mutants have always existed albeit in very few numbers. Thanos or the Hulk's snap amplified the number of mutants worldwide,1
Yea they toss that shit out the window like 15 min in but that's what supposed to happen,1
That happens with new videos lol,1
where hulk,1
They can be good movies and still despicable. All any superhero movie is at this point is a blind cash grab with the only thing that actually matters being how much money they make.,0
What you don't remember? Maybe what? What the fuck are you talking about? Put up an age like a man and tell her what you think tough guy. ,1
A trailer and a poster out of nowhere!? **claps** MAGNIFICENT! MAGNIFICENT! MAGNIFICENT!,1
"Oh please no, that's way too dark",2
Cooler heads prevailed.  Glad to see Sony knew what was best for them and this franchise.,1
Tony and Nebula look so cool,1
Fuck. Yes.,1
Ted Cruz is a professional at pissing people off,1
*MYSTERIIOOOOOO!*,2
"Love how dark this trailer is, without it being overdone, it works and the great sense of hope at the end feels wonderful. A dark time, but heroes come up to do.........whatever it takes.",1
That's interesting,1

It looks like Vision.,1
"I mean we almost know nothing about in which direction Marvel is going other than some rumored upcoming projects,..... people will die to get anything from the man himself.",0
Ben Urich was black in the MCU.,1
If this is sarcasm then nice one but if this isn t then yikes ,3
"That ain't even subtle. He's all but saying that they will cross over. Im not sure how I feel alot that. While I dislike how Venom is separated from the MCU, the movie wasn't half bad actually.  For that reason, there's a good chance that the other movies could be decent or dare I say good. If it turns out that the Sonyverse isn't garbage, then I guess it's okay. I'll be pissed if they try some bullshit like rebooting Spider-man.  I just don't want this to ruin the good track record the MCU has with Spidey.",1
*almost NO idea Missed a key word there buddy  ,1
"Hey Kevin, just want to say thanks for making the MCU what it is, no one else could have done it. I would like to ask you if there is anything you are more excited to reveal than other things. A movie or a new character or a villain? Just a yes or no question.",1
I though tony was the one she touched. ,1
THIS LOOKS INSANE,1
Is it just me or does Thanos look/sound different than he has in previous movies?,1
Dunno why but he reminds me of Fred Durst,1

I can't wait to see how powerful Carol is. ,1
"No, because he knew the 50  has been unsnapped and his work undone. And it wasn't satisfied look. It was wry and bitter smile, acknowledging that he has lost. I feel like you might watched a different version of Endgame.",3
Bruh your name is awes0mesteve and you're trying to tell people they're being cringey. Grow the fuck up let people enjoy their lives.,1
Who is your favorite of the Defenders actors?,1
Definitely a Pinocchio / Jiminy Cricket reference.,3
As opposed to the DC formula which has been batman and superman focused for decades,1
"True, but does it have all those Nintendo characters in their first big crossover?",1
It s got a real green lantern vibe to it ,2
My favorite Cap suit out of all of them. Fuckin sign me up ,3

Inhumans also killed IMAX s foray into scripted content. The exec who greenlit it was fired and they killed the whole division after their first project. It was an incredible disaster for IMAX.,1

Am I the only one that sees Zac Efron instead of Chris in that picture?,1
Sorry but this is slightly nitpicky. I have bad internet to begin with so this is natural for me. Blu Ray will obviously look better every time.,1

"Yeah, that's what I don't like about these things. It's cool that he gets to see it early but he only did because he thought to post on reddit about it and get an army of  622k people to push for him. Who knows how many terminally ill people would love to see Endgame but won't get to.",3

"Two questions. One, What movie in the MCU are you most impressed by? Two, are you disappointed that you never got to make a sequel to the Incredible Hulk",1
Yeah my problem was that I always wanted to see him mutate into his alloy covered self in a film. While I did get that out of x3 I didn't get much more screen time out of him afterwards and he was a teen. In dp he was pretty awesome in every way except we didn't see him in human form ever through 2 films.,1

"I mean, I don't get the decision because I don't understand what they're planning to do with them. The Eternals aren't interesting, and they aren't really a concept that brings anything to the MCU at this point.  It kind of just feels like the picked them because they're a big group of characters that no one would mind being changed to be more diverse. Which is fair, but they're going to have to do a lot to make them interesting for more than brownie points.",0

You deleted it. Why,2
"I could not agree more. Also, I had problems with some of Brie Larson s delivery of certain lines. I m not sure if that s something I should blame on the director or the actor. There was that line on the trailer where she says,  I m gonna end it.  I feel her delivery was so weak. I am hoping Emily Blunt gets cast as Sue Storm.",1

Giant-Man looks ready to seriously kick some ass.,1
Thanos will ascend in Avengers 4,2
 I like the team suits a lot better in action (AND TONY'S BACK!!!!) Glad they've acknowledged them. So glad it barely shows anything (yet again). So glad that they showed a lot from the previous films. Whatever fight scene Cap (and Nebula) is in looks fucking *intense*. Scott definitely emerged in the modern day. So glad about Rocket's outfit.  This is gonna be so fucking good I can't wait. God I'm excited.,3
No he was the same goofy nerd in IW and Endgame,1
For sure. It's just funny. It's more symbolic. I'm sure he doesn't care about the collectability,3
I thought it was a really awful K. ff makes more sense.,3
It makes sense.  She s highly invested with the movie s success and she obviously has a handle on the character and her motivations.,1
literally all the comments that think they have solved some fucking mystery,1
It's impractical to remove yourself completely. That would be isolationism. Not donating to a church supporting abuse is much different than not wearing clothes because of evil manufacturers. One is a practical practice and the other isn't. ,1
Ah yes of course ,1

She's also almost smiling  ,2
I'm just here to comment that I'm absolutely not watching ANY trailers about this. I want to go into this movie blind to the hype and fanfare because JFC it's Captain Marvel. ,1
Cloak   Dagger deserves to go on. Such a great show.,2
"Really? I appreciate the work he as done as much as anyone here, but to say that is just disingenuous to the millions of people who do have to work hard for a living.  Don't get me wrong, I Love the Marvel Movies, but I don't pretend that Hollywood work is more difficult then people who barely scrape by. ",2
"Multiverse of madness can set up a lot of crossovers depending on what direction that movie takes. They could simply have a small scene like that space trip strange took in the first movie, where they go though different dimensions and tease a lot of stuff that way. I think that movie will set up a lot of things.",3
Or only some characters stay dead at the end,3
That two armies running at each other scene in Wakanda is seriously hype! So cool to see hulk with them,3
"He was born December 28, 1922, which explains the 12.1922 after his name.",3
The God Butcher is a great story and could be a great movie with a well cast villain,1
"> all I can remember about Vision is that Hawkeye fucking beats him in Civil War Vision explicitly tells Hawkeye he can't beat him, Hawkeye agrees, and then Hawkeye says  but she can  and nods towards Wanda. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYzk0OOSCAo)",2
"It's different because James Gunn didn't say anything racist *at* someone, *and* also didn't dress up as Hitler and burn jewish gingerbread cookies....***and*** also did not recently have a public meltdown.",2
Same thought. My guess is it can deploy some mini vibranium shields or something.,3
That OG Avengers money can pay for WAY better lawyers.,1
The Hulk and Wolverine draw  mass  from the same place Pym Particles pull it from/shunt it to. The meat dimension thing is a fan joke... ...right?,3
"It's almost like Trump hasn't shown any sign of change of character since then (comments about his daughter, the whole shooting a guy and not losing voters thing) and was also running for fucking POTUS. Last I checked Gunn was just a movie director, not one of the most powerful men in the world that should kinda be a bit of a role model and definitely should be held to higher standards than the average person",1
Where is Coulson?,1
We all need a friend like him.,2
"> Time Stone shenanigans That alone means literally *anyone* can die. Maybe almost everybody. I'm still leaning towards the idea that Thanos wipes almost everyone out and the sequel is Strange using the time stone to rebuild the team- picking up missing heroes from the past, and grabbing Captain Marvel while he's at it.",3
Is that really a bad thing?,1
"Holy shit, this has got to be the single dumbest comment I've ever read on this site. There is no such thing as a video codec that will change brightness and you have completely made that up. Not to mention Disney+ uses H.264 and H.265, the same thing used in Blu-rays. Holy fucking shit.",0
This is the first Marvel movie where I have no clue what the hell is going to happen,1
"Excellent. Never actually seen Avatar because it looks soooo goofy. And the snippets I ve seen in, like, Best Buy were really cringey and poorly acted.  Saw it three times in the theater. It stands w IW   Spider-Man: FFH as my favorite MCU films. Can t wait for the 4K Blu-ray.",1
I can t see him he s standing too still,1
It s because he s way shorter and he s using the wrong hand to choke Vision.,1
Avatar is a theater (3D) experience. That's why it did so well.,2
It was.  But his presence with the Avengers would hold more weight.  He was supposedly the reason they finally rallied together.,1
"Enterprising Young Men is a great piece of music though. It's echoed in many other parts of the film too, like  Nero Fiddles, Narada Burns  and  Back to Black .",3
I can only get so erect!!,1
"Now I'm imagining Tony and Bruce trying to teach Steve how to use certain things or them being called to help out with his computer when something goes wrong, but he has all the understanding of a typical 70 year old.",1
(Yeah!),1
I wonder if there isn t another reason they don t like these like they are soaking up all the money and all the studios are trying to emulate them instead of maki g a lot of smaller movies.,3
"Hey Man, congrats on being able to watch the Avengers Endgame early!",3
You're joking right? You do see that those are in the same in that they're unable to exist without the other? I refuse to believe you're just that idiotic.,0
Fuck this is so cringy. A tree talking to a godamn raccoon. I mean do you people have rocks in your brain?,0

So glad they did this. Tired of social media blackmail from years ago. Can t wait to see his upcoming projects.,1
"This is awesome, plus you look like Jake Gyllenhaal too!",1
THAT was the scaled-down version?!,3
A huge part of the MCU started and ended with Ironman. One of my favorite characters for the last 20+ years. Was that in the  Blueprint  from the beginning? And moving forward are there plans for similar  Grand  story arcs to encompass years worth of movies?,1
So if all of his family survived does that mean he'll sit another one out?,1
Terrible decision,1
Take my hand and swear it,2
Maybe that s foreshadowing ,2
Harry Potter meets Strange in an epic showcase of magical prowess,2
"Ronan was just one of many Kree military leaders ranking below the Kree Supreme Inteligence, their highest leader. Once the Kree end their wars and are forced to peace, Ronan goes rogue and tries to destroy Xandar with his personal (with Thanos help).",1
I hope it s buff Thor again and not fat Thor.,1
GRAVITY II? Can't wait to see Tony in his pants.,1
Oh shit I was not aware. Honestly though at least the avatar version had extra content. The second endgame felt like a cop out.,1
Well from what we saw in Endgame the Ancient One had front row seats and probably added Loki to the list right then.,3
Gabe Newell confirmed head of Sony,1
I'm usually so happy about that but I'll be honest I really wanted everything spoiled for me this time. Humans can't be happy with stuff like that I guess,1
I got chills!,1
Are there any plans to make a movie with the whole MCU like Deadpool and the X-Men? This would be a very cool crossover to see and a large crowd pleaser.,1
Jumanji 2 is out already????,1
Is Deadpool able to have a cameo in Marvel movies now?,3
Thor and Carol are so gonna bang,1

"I like it, but the funeral was much more poignant.  This would've been really great if it came off as less corny, and had all the heroes standing around Tony/Pepper, with their heads down in mourning. Would've been a cool way to see *everyone* in costume in one, clear shot like  this. (url) As cool as *Portals* was, it was definitely a clusterfuck. And maybe with the same silence as the original death scene, and shorter than this, so that it didn't take the impact away from the funeral.",2
You can see she is faking her smile cuz she hates white male,1
I'm betting that Rocket is just gonna go completely nuts in this movie. The only thing more dangerous than a  man  raccoon with everything to lose is one who has nothing to lose.,3

"Honestly the seasons get better as they go on, really had to find their stride. The most recent season felt shockingly low budget, but it was still enjoyable.",1
Interesting. I gotta rewatch it again I think. Ty,1
They re definitely scrapped. What s exciting is the prospect of Marvel Studios attracting top talent to make Marvel Animation on Disney+. A new good Avengers series would be amazing (or continuing Earths Mightiest Heroes).,3
Part of the journey is the end is the most terrifying line ever holy shit I m not ready. ,1
Yeah me neither.. it's just not something one would like to think of when a beloved person has passed.,2

I used to imagine him being a world class jerk but nice to be wrong.,1
"She didn't really replace him in the comics either. He was still out there. And film wise, he's completed his story arc. I don't think he needs a full solo film any more. I was actually worried when they announced Thor 4 before SDCC, because I have no idea what they have left for him. Jane as Thor is refreshing though.",1

My questions for you are the following:  1- what has been the hardest thing about connecting all the movies into a single universe? 2- were you expecting all this when you released Iron Man 1. 3- if there was one thing you would change or add to the MCU, what would it be? Thank you for everything, We love you 3000.",2

Do you guys put the word quantum in front of everything?,3
With Spider-Man wearing a fucking iron man spidey suit at that.,1

Jacob Batalon being bald is so weird.,1
He actually doesn't know a lot of people on that battlefield (all those ships coming through Strange's portals?).  It's the stones' job to determine who is who and there's no logical reason for Gamora to be dusted when she was fighting on the Avengers side the entire time.,1

"Eh, Uncle Ben has straight up been replaced by Tony Stark in this series. Ancient One not being from Tibet was catering to the Chinese. Demon in a Bottle was a low point in an already iffy Iron Man 2 where Tony Stark pees in his Iron Man suit and fights Rhodey at his birthday party.",1

"Well that's just it... the implication is that he was affecting the consumers, not just life.  Notice not a single tree turned to dust in any of the scenes?   just people   Same when he was exterminating Gamora's people.  He didn't light the world on fire... just slaughtered  people .",1
Watch it until you see the the Cap shield scene we saw in the previous trailer and don't watch after that,3
This should be all Uncle Ben's.,1
And therein lies the poor writing. The writers have plainly stated their intent with the script.,0

"He's Canadian. But also, he's apparently clumsy to the point of it being life threatening (He said so on a Top Gear interview)",1
marvel movies are overrated rehashed trash. ,0
"Whether it was through comics, the MCU or even video games (shoutout Spider-Man on N64), Stan had a mark on millions and millions worldwide.  This one fucking hurts..RIP",1
Once but it's the whole time.,1
"It's just because their political views are so ass backwards that they have nothing to contribute, and I mean that. It's a political movement based on pissing off people that disagree with them.  Trump supporters' opinions are valueless everywhere.",1
"To get more of the actor's face time in screen, duh! /s",3
"Hey Kevin, how was the moment, for you, that you realized  This is happening, we are creating a marvel cinematographic universe ? It must have been the dream of your life. Thanks to you and everyone involved for this incredible ride!",1
The one in 17million chance they'd win has Tony surviving the snap and being sparred by Thanos.  It kinda isn't fair since Dr Strange presumably set up Thanos to ultimately fail. Strange plays a strong long game.,1
Tiger Woods is on that track again. I don't think any sports mega-star fell harder than he did. ,3
OP you could ve looked a *bit* more enthused in this photo. ,1
"LORD FEIGE,  DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU!?",1
"It's a decoy. It's actually transparent aluminum, like in Star Trek. People try to shoot her there,   it doesn't work,   she uses their confusion to bash their skulls in with Mjolnir.",2
Peter Parker origin one shot,1
"Still fighting with the horde. He didn't have a communication device like the rest of them so he didn't know that thanos is there when cap called everyone. Either way, it didn't take him long to get there. Remember that the Thanos wrecking scene is all in slow-mo, in reality he wrecked them in like a minute or two.",1
All of those movies made a shit ton of money. You could say they have a history of making bad creative decisions with the property. But business wise it s all been rather lucrative for them.,1
You just know that one scene with Cap tightening his shield is his death one,1
So has Bautista said anything yet?,1
There is a ridiculous amount of comments and I am so impressed that you re answering all these questions. Sorry if you already answered this/something similar.  I ve been hearing a lot about how the cast shot a bunch of endings for Endgame to reduce spoilers  is that true? If so can we ever see and/or know what the other ending are?,1
Nailed it OP,1
It is Rogue's biological mother.,0

The very bright colour scheme is super 70s though.,1
They re not starting from scratch. They still have Holland and the director. After that they ll have to restart anyway.,1
"Was there a post accusing him of lying? I guess I'm naive, but I took his story at face value and have been cheering the poor dude on. ",2
Anyone who believes in stupid Jewish conspiracies,1
"THANOS!!!! I love how he hasn't even bothered with the helmet or the armor or even his floating chair. Like the Avengers are not even a threat, just a day of amusement.  It's like a day at the beach for him. Hell - I want someone to Photoshop a Hawaiian shirt on him with a pair of sunnies resting on his head.",1
RIP Stan Lee. Today the earth stands still. Today all the superheroes and villains stand still. Today we lost someone who made us disconnect from this world and took us on adventures beyond our imagination. Today we lost a Titan. May he rest in piece. Prayers to him and all his family.,1
"I upvoted even without seeing the photo, I loooved everything about Hella. The portrayal that Cate Blanchett did was terrific.",1
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS?,1
Ohhhh fuck yeah. It s time to put balls in holes.,1
"Hi, how are y all going to make the 5 year difference when people were  snapped  work in upcoming movies like Spider-Man far from home?",1
I have a similar signature as his.,1
"Only problem I have is that She Hulk model man, she kinda looks like Gamora lmao. Great job tho I agree that MCU has a bright future in phase 4 and 5 especially with F4 finally debuting with the MCU!",1
so you're saying noobmaster69 is the Living Tribunal?,2
"the quote is from a Cohen Brothers movie,  the ballad of buster scruggs  on Netflix. It's a cute movie, neither of these actors is in it.",1
u/anthony-russo,1
"Awesome, I'm glad you had the experience you wanted.  Just understand that opening night audiences are typically made of the crowd that is very invested and very hyped for the movie.  If you want peace and quiet, see a daytime showing, give it a week or so, or go to a theater that expressly prohibits noise (like Alamo Drafthouse).",2
*Sycophantic:* behaving or done in an obsequious way in order to gain advantage.,1

"but for jessica jones, they just showed like nothing.  from the little i remember, she woke up one day being able to stop cars.........something something she was a slave to kilgrave or whatever for a while........and that was it.  is there more to show for her? given how much i didn't like iron fist, i don't care to see another origin for him.  i don't know what would make it good.",1
"She's a Carol, not a Karen.",1
"* Oh, she has a sword? Okay, I'm guessing she's qualified too. Welcome aboard. By the way Iron Hand, sworn enemy of the foot clan? This is my attorney. You're being served with a cease and desist notice for copyright infringement. I usually don't care, but yesterday someone asked if you were my sidekick. *",3
"Yes he did, right below Zoe. ",3
But not us.,2
That whole story is so misleading to begin with. Pratt DOESNT support Hillsong and the only connection to it is his church that affiliates with them. Even then you can't fucking blame him for something others do.,1
"He'd also be able to assemble 5 of the 6 Infinity stones, tell Thor to have Etri forge them into a badass hammer and have Infinity Thor and Captain Marvel fuck up Thanos early.  (Has to wait for Thor to have his  worthy  arc in Thor 1, just to be safe).",3
Not to mention the dude has a freaking nutsack for a chin,2

There is a god,1
"I doubt it, Marvel Studios might be willing to let some time pass on the subject of Apocalypse, as that was not a very good representation.  They might keep him aside for future movies.",1
Yeah. Every time! ,1
"If the rumors are true that Captain Marvel is Secret Invasion, then it s gonna be Brie. If it s Avengers 5 and Thor is still in it, then Hemsworth.",1
I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait.  This trailer gave me goosebumps and hyped for it....  ,1
Stop spamming this.,1
I'll give you *12?*,1
This is a great answer LOL,1
Jarhead is my personal favorite gyllenhaal movie,1
"Best wishes to you, man. I really hope you get to see it. ",1
Me crossing my fingers hoping for a Deathshead II movie. LOL.,1
Nope i think it isn't. Disney still had rights to animated spiderman movies and all the merchandise. Sony can only make live action movies (excluding when they made a deal with Disney with animated for example Spiderverse).,1

Nice but which weapon he will use? I suggest double blade or gauntlet with all the stones... Snap forbidden but 1 stone each time or without stones too,1
"Oh, duh. Figured there was an actual leak I just wasn't aware of",1
"I am happy for this karma, but I am literally vibranium diamonds at my office computer",2
Plus her whole vajayjay stone gimmick,1
I like how goggles on the right isn't even touching his face. Basically like shooting a gun without a rear sight. Also shooting bows sideways is even more retarded than holding a gun sideways,1
Endgame's 'America's Ass' was pretty cringeworthy and Black Panther's 'what're those' off the top of my head.,1
MAGNIFICENT! M A G N I F I C E N T!,1
Angela Bassett in Black Panther,2
"As amazing as this trailer was though, I do think Thanos looked a bit off. He wasn't very intimidating for some reason, and it might have been because of the lack of armor. I loved his look in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie.",1
The Avengers have never lost a fight that had Hawkeye in it. That s all I m saying.,2
There's no way the world can add more awesomeness this week. I think it's impossible.,1
Does anyone have some orange slices??,3
It's like a self-insert fanfic,3
f yes. Let's do this.,3
"Lots of other actors in other series do this  the difference with the MCU is that its led by a genuine fan, not a dictatorial jackass.",3
"I guess, it's based in history and in the comics so it's not just representation for representations sake so I never really thought of it that way. Captain Marvel is the only character in the MCU that bothers me when it comes to that type of thing and most of that is just because of Brie Larson.",1
"Hey champ, it s okay to lose your temper once in awhile. ",0
Correction: Thanos is the good man who won ,3
"I actually agree on that, as a trailer it didn't too much for me outside the bit I mentioned, there's some cool imagery but it just felt a little standard. ",1
yay!  this was always going  to  happen but i was about to lose  hope,1
When I saw the transitions I was like  oh shit this looks like the halo trailer edits I see on YouTube  then I saw your username lmao.,1

Where s Parker?,1
"Hard to say, Captain Marvel one shotting Sanctuary II is a pretty crazy feat,",3

FETCH THE DOUG STRETCHER,3
Thanos looks like he s limping ,1
"Hi Kevin, thanks for doing this AMAA. Are there any projects you wish you could have done but were unable to due to your commitments to Marvel? Is there anything you wish you could change about the MCU in terms of overall story?",1
"It would ve been a cool concept, but having The Avengers, and Avengers, is like having Fast   Furious and The Fast and the Furious, it would ve just been kinda confusing going forward ",3
Boy their marketing interns sure do work hard.,3
 Awesome awesome,1
while it's my opinion I feel like the chi other than the first iron man was meh nothing special,1

"What was the most emotional scene for you, in Endgame?",1
I dreamed I was old ,2
If anything it would be the Fantastic Four out in space,0
So does this mean ONLY one more movie?,1
"Depends, what are the benefits?",1
"Seriously though, what the fuck is he doing in that scene?",1
Looks like a Pornstar,2
Release order. Always release order,1
 You want another movie you better stand in front of the sign and smile ,1
"I'm probably going to regret not asking any more at some point in the future but this is the only question I've had in my head as of late: Was Thanos's decimation of Xandar hinting at a Nova movie? If not, does Xandar still exist? Is it rebuilding after Thanos's attack?",1
Wow I m sad :(,1

"And the implications of Christ's resurrection... Would Christianity or other religions have the impact that they have today when, like, your nextdoor neighbor can do the same thing but with whistles?",1
"I think they will slowdown after 2023, Marvel wants to complete old franchises like GOTG, Deadpool etc   also want to release new franchise so 4-4 movies are in 2021- 2023. From 2024 I think they would make 3 movie per year.",1
I bet you can't find  the cheese  in this photo...,1

Yeah... You really won that one. ,1
What's your thoughts on Miles Morales coming to the MCU?,1
"I'm right there with you. Nebula getting the gauntlet is at the top of my list of things I want to see happen in this, along with a Hawkeye/Antman teamup and Thanos surviving the movie to show up in a later film (Annihilation, please).",3
They simply execute him as the credits are rolling,1
This means they banged right?,1
There's another interview where they both said everybody died. I think they're trying to fool the interviewers and Cheadle was pretending to be upset. But who knows.,2

"Endgame made me pretty nostalgic for older Marvel films -- I re-watched what I could between what I owned already and what was out there to stream, but it definitely had me wishing I could just get everything with one purchase, maybe in a nice package.

 hello I hate it when people use it on me.,1
goose bumps and whole lot of  yaassss!,1
"If you re willing to believe in gods of thunder, celestial beings and magicians then you wouldn t make a petty argument about who owns a house. That is my point. Maybe we need to discuss what taxes Tony Stark paid and where the hulk went to primary school. Whilst we re at it, what testicle did Clint Barton come out from? )",1
Coul-el-karot,3
Why Gamora?,1
How sexy is Chris Hemwsworth in real life?,1
"Why couldn't cap show up 5 seconds after instead? Actually, that's more accurate, since if it was the way you said it, she would have 2 infinity stones, the one cap gives her, and the one she has already before cap appears, since banner hasn't shown up to take it from her yet",1
Someone pls call the pun patrol ,1
holy moly... Must be fun huh being a mod? Not having time to even watch the trailer coz people are shit posting... I am sorry if i gave any of you mods a hard time. You guys deserve to see the Endgame 1 week before.,3

Spiderman is about to be in a bunch of movies in the next few years.,1
"It would be cool if Tchalla supported Steve, Sam and Natasha by sending them Wakandan artifacts while they were on the run. Just like Tony helped Peter by providing him Stark tech.",3
"Loki taking the space stone absolutely created a new timeline, but that s the only instance that does.  Aether- Steve returns it to the very time it was taken, thus averting an alternate timeline. Same as with every other stone. That was the entire point of the movie.  How are you that dense?",1
I love how Spiderman/ Tom Holland isnt in the scene because he would have definitely spoiled this.,1
"Always knew Spiderman was coming back to the MCU, I mean really what was Sony going to do they can't use like  90  of the story that's out already for Spiderman. How where they going to say anything about any Tech he has with out saying Tony, what about Shield, Happy. Even the villains have the origins set in the MCU. The deck was stacked against them to begin with.",3

"That's the best way! So pleased that we're going to be able to all walk into this film not having a clue what to expect. How often is that the case in cinema nowadays? Trailers have been known to spoil too much too often, so I'm thankful they're not doing that with this. ",1
"Feige said it will be  an epic spanning tens of thousands of years,  so expect that. It was also said that they arrived on Earth 35,000 years ago, so probably then to modern day. But that s just my presumption.",1

"I really hope this movie is a big step up from the last 2. Ant-Man 1 and 2, while fun, don't really feel essential at all. Ant-Man 3 needs to be a game-changer in the universe and really push it forward. Putting the Young Avengers in it is a good idea. You can still have those family vibes that the Ant-Man movies do so well, yet make it feel a lot more important.",3

Remember how stupid at times they had to make Vision? How he could have ended the whole fight in Civil War by himself? You would need to make Quicksilver that stupid over multiple conflicts for him to not end things by himself.,1

I had so many more stories to hear!! R.I.P.,1
New Spider-Man movies would definitely still make money but I think it's hard going back to a closed universe after you're in something like the MCU. It's going to make it feel a lot smaller. It'll still make bank but not quite as much as it could.,1

"People didn t leave their clothes behind either, heck - Bucky s metal arm got snapped too because it was  part of his persona  or whatever the explanation was.  It s kind of a weird situation though, because we know from Endgame that using the stones to destroy them takes a similar amount of energy as the snap itself. Maybe he WAS supposed to be snapped away but the stones simply couldn t do it?",3
"Tony and cap reunion, I cannot wait",1
"I respectfully disagree with your opinion. I think Endgame had a better character development which Infinity War lacked. Endgame focussed on the characters and capping off the Infinity Saga. Infinity War on the other hand had great action in it and a very tight pace, however if it hadn't been a culmination, it too would have felt like it had a 'little substance', like it was just spectacle with action figures fighting.",1

"Most of the time people use  strong  in a general superhero sense like this, they mean holistically. Not literal  I can bench 1000 pounds  strength, but overall powers. So yes he d inherit his toughness, and it s implied that he does in the movie because Thanos slices his leg and he s still walking.",1
"I feel like I wouldn't like that because of the cliffhanger in endgame for Quill and Gamora, but I could respect that. There is a huge gap in years between Vol. 2 and Infinity War. That could also mean that Thor 4 could expand on that cliffhanger and we'd get a Thor centric story featuring the whole Guardians team. Possibilities are endless!",3

"I had a guy on Discord on Friday say the movie was bad and that he wasn t going to see it because Brie Larson said he wasn t allowed to because it wasn t meant for white men.

And then some sort of escape ensues because of the chaos. Maybe a guard had opened a door and then vanished. Etc. Zemo's out.",1

"I see a lot of people divided on whether or not Tom Holland's Spidey will appear in the Sony-verse as well as the MCU without the two being connected, or appearing in both and connecting the two universes. Personally, I read it as he'll appear in both universes WITHOUT them being connected. So no Venom in the MCU. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Seems it'll be pretty confusing to the average viewer seeing a Spider-man movie with the same actor but suddenly no mention of Stark.",1

Hey Kevin! Congrats on EndGame s box office success. We know how much Stan Lee s comics  influenced the MCU. Did Stan himself have much of an influence on Phases 1-3 and did he have any input on the movies as a whole ? Also did Stan get to watch EndGame?,2
What do you mean? There's only been one Thor movie.,1
It s from incredible 2,3
I agree. Krasinksi would have been great. I still applaud them for picking Evans though because Captain America is my favourite Avenger and a large part of that is his casting. I am well on board for the Krasinsi/Blunt Fantastic Four fan casting.,1

Because Sony won t get any money from putting it on Disney+ Same reason why Incredible Hulk isn t and won t be on there,2
I just love the fact the on reddit people are talking about this. Just an in-reddit thing to do,1
I'd wager they knew it almost instantly but had to wait for the heat to die down. I would not at all be surprised if Gunn had been low-key working on the film all this time with a verbal agreement that he'd be brought back on board. Notice how there's not been a lot of heat from GotG cast and crew since October or so?,3
Extra creepy lord Voldemort ,1
"I really hope they bring Daredevil back, with the same actors. Charlie Cox is amazing. Also I know Bullseye is just a 'regular' human, but he's the one guy in the entirety of the MCU I wouldn't want to see square off against the Avengers. Unless you're say Hulk or Thor, he's a serious threat.",3

I think the problem people had with Ultron is that he isn't really physically impressive.,3
Thor s battle cry 10/10,3
"Fisher's death was certainly more tragic, but it doesn't make her death more personal. This will definitely sound insensitive, but plenty of stars and regular people die in tragic situations, and we don't cry for all of them...

I vote for Korg and Miek to join the Guardians. ,1
I'm incredibly intrigued to see how Thor survives that fucking head squeeze ,1
I think a series fits it better...allows them to do more plot lines. A movie would have to be very focused on just a few changes. A tv series is also way more like a comic series imo,1

"My eye was drawn to the woman with the blue head. Also, I think in a trailer where the colour red is emphasised a thing blue automatically draws attention. I didn t notice Tony until the second view.",1
Yeah he s in set photos and he filmed for months.,1
"A lot of people have been saying this but nobody says why. My personal theory is that he's scared of Hulking out again, so when it's time to fight maybe he tries to help by using the suit (this is backed up by the fact that he helped develop the suit, making him the only other person besides Tony capable of using it). I imagine a shot where he Hulks out inside the suit when things get to be too much for Banner ",1
Magic. He got pretty good at it while under house arrest. ,1
I think that s mostly because dozens of people asks him to do it whenever he steps out the house. I could see that becoming old really quick. ,3
Okoye seems very intelligent and 100  was the one to take charge after the snap,0
"I have a few questions for you Lord Feige, see if you can answer any of the below.  1) What was the pressure like behind directing Endgame? 2) How did you come to the conclusion for each characters arc?

"She shoots firebolts from her hands like she was in Misfits of Science and has powers that they have a chart literally named Bullshit Powers for.

I think that s just how the trailer is cut. I kind of thought it was addressed to a group. Like whoever is trying to face him at the time he s in that dialogue,3
"Some folks are just so jaded that they take a cynical stance on even the most petty of issues. Ridiculous that even when presented with a situation like this one, their only concern is for themselves in the hypothetical scenario that this guy leaks spoilers. I'm glad the overall response to his situation has been positive, but the number of people being douchebags towards a terminally ill person they've never met is something else.

"Doubt they ll touch on it honestly. It s not exactly character defining,",0
"We know we're losing several characters in this film, and I'm pretty sure that will include at least one of the Guardians. Gamora probably as well, if we're getting some heavy development of her character in this film. On top of that I'm fairly certain that Drax's desire for revenge against Thanos is going to end up getting him killed.",2
"It is not contradictory. Where stories start, stop, and pause have a place within the creation of a narrative. Cliffhangers are a very obvious example of this fact. But ending a segment of a story at an arbitrary time has absolutely nothing to do with the actual creative process. I can only try to make this clear to you in so many different ways. I'm done responding. You either get it or you don't.",1

If you know your friend is going through severe depression and an existential crisis leaving him alone for years on end is leaving him out to dry. His depression is literally a repeated joke throughout the film. Thor's arc from Ragnarok and Infinity War becomes a joke throughout the movie and Hulk's is skipped over entirely. It's some significant weak points in the film.,2

A few years ago, I believe you mentioned that you did not consider the marvel TV shows canon (Not the new Disney+ ones, but the Netflix shows, Agent Carter, and Agents of Shield).

The stones emitt gamma rays. All that gamma radiation from 3 earth based snaps awakens the dormant x-gene that was planted by Celestials Millions of years ago. This explains the sudden surge in mutants and guys like wolverine/Xavier can already be mutants but very rare The Celestial stuff can also retcon SW and Quicksilver to be mutants whose x-genes were awakened by the mind stone.

This rule applies to writing in Marvel and anywhere else too. When you see a characters family you shouldn t just see  juicy drama targets! Sorry had to get that off my chest. My DM messed up a great session last week by introducing family drama that turned the whole thing into a trite, predictable Taken situation in the final hour.",2

"Which baffles the mind even more because the Thor reality literally have space/time portals and thousands of years of potential history.

I just hope that however long you have left is the best time of your life. You don't deserve this shitty asshole of a disease but let it know who's boss and just enjoy whatever you have left.   My heart is with you and everyone around you. Stay strong brother!,2
"Yeah I knew it wasn t real, I just thought it was entirely cgi considering how much cgi they d already done",3
"> Ebony Maw He's not really fucking powerful, that's not really the point of the character.  He doesn't really have any powers at all. At least in the comics, he tricks Strange into summoning something horrible.  He doesn't (and couldn't) directly beat him.  He outsmarts him.",2
That Mysterio dude sure seems to be a great guy!,1
Those fuckers never work properly lol,1
I feel like Happy can probably get a jet if he needs one at this point without having to ask.,1
"I see alot of comments about this being forced because they didn't know him, but look at it this way: the man sacrificed himself to save the whole universe. I imagine them kneeling out of respect",1
"No they don t? Why should they alter the terms of a deal that s lucrative for both sides, for a property that they own, because Disney wants a bigger slice of pie for something they don t own?  Both sides were making money. Disney wanted more money for something it fundamentally does not own. Disney s at fault here. If Sony had tried to change the terms of the deal after the contact s completion to better suit themselves, they d be at fault. But only one side wanted to change the deal.",1
"As a Catholic it bothers me because they're genuflecting on the right knee to a person. To people, you're supposed to genuflect on the left knee. Great scene though I also prefer the funeral, like some have said",1
God damn. This looks good. Really fucking good. I haven t been hyped for a Marvel film in a while and this one is doing the trick. ,1
"I see where your going, but even those one offs are still tied to a central story about the main narrative that drive the story forward.  This would be less about the Avengers story and more about what is interesting about Black Widow.  Is there a BW comic that was a home run that this could be based on?  I'm not familiar enough with the source material.",1
Fucking chill like 3 times throughout that trailer.  I can t wait. ,1
 Doom isn't a cool character  hahahahaha!,2

Well I like space Thor a hell of a lot better than Thor1 or 2,3
Got a title or anything? would love to read it,1
As did I! Also seemed like a cool nod back to Winter Soldier where Sam holds the same kind of meetings. ,1
 And get this raccoon that guy's prosthetic leg. ,2
"They should have had the first person kneeling closer. It's awkward the way they all look back and see the person behind them is kneeling. If one person up front had done it they all could have gone down at about the same time and it would have looked a lot more natural. Even so, I think the funeral scene was better anyway.",1
"I think Gunn is silent because he's trying to make sure he doesn't say the wrong thing (hell, look at Roseanne's tactless tweets from the past two months. I don't think Gunn would ever be as tone deaf as Roseanne but he's still a very outspoken person, and I think he's trying not to let his outspokenness get the best of him). I think it's also plausible that he's in a depression right now. ",2
Why wouldn't they have Charlie Cox? ,1
"Meanwhile, people say Captain Marvel is the OP one?",0
"> That's pretty much the end of discussion for me at this point. From this point it just looks like you are trying to convince yourself otherwise. It's kinda amazing to see someone stick their entire  hands  in their ears before singing  LALALALALA , but really, it was entertaining.",1
"The second she opens that door and sees him pretty much wipes out the possibility of her having that future, so she never gets that choice. This Peggy is a different person than his Peggy. Her potential future husband is a different person than Peggy's husband in the main timeline, so yes, he is stealing that man's future as well. There's also another Cap in that timeline, so he's stealing her from him as well.",1
Glad they made the right decision and Gunn was open to coming back. ,2
For that comment you deserve my soul,2
Unless it transports Angier then makes a copy on the center point.,1
"I did read your comment - your criticism makes no sense. If you ignore all the parts where the female character fails, then every strong female character becomes a Mary Sue. A Mary Sue is by definition without flaws, and usually the best at whatever she does. It s like calling Thor a Gary Stu because he usually succeeds at everything except for the times he fails.",2

If you look at the Hulk's fighting style it's based on emotions and rage, it's strong but childlike, whereas Thanos IS a fighter, he was able to counter it and beat Hulk regardless of the stone.",1
Yup. The blue is noticeable everywhere. Red would ve been too high energy- they showed the dead avengers with the red to show the happiness of the avengers is gone with them. Now its all bleak. I love this.,3

Hank Pym was despite their differences a colleague of his father for many years and he was the person who first invented the Pym particles they used to even begin the time heist in the first place. And it also look that most of the funerals attendee's brought most of their families. Like Black Panther did with Shuri. I really like Selvig but he hasn't been important in years and he and Tony share 1 moment with eachother and that was Tony nearly blowing him up.,3

Avatar was a movie that Cameron had wanted to make since his childhood but he had yo wait for good enough tech Also fyi it was never meant to be a single movie, but a 7-part series.

My friend is convinced that s Nova at the 1:40 mark. Is he an idiot or is he on to something?,1
I see what you're trying to get at but that's completely irrelevant. I wouldn't let anyone other than family babysit my kids.,2
I thought it was interesting that no Hulk in the trailer either...,1
I don't think this is over for good.  The show was too popular.  Disney may have some plans.,1
Maybe he didnt see Thanos as a rhreat because in certain timelines he doesnt exist since he as went to the present.,1

Whilst ** is ** his head so obviously pasted on top of the Hulkbuster's CG is truly the detail I despise the most out of the whole movie : ,2
"IMO he looks way *less* silly. I know comic book fans would disagree, but a lot of the comic-y outfits, particularly headgear look absolutely ridiculous in live action movies and take away from the believably of the character.   In this trailer, when thanos walks out of the portal, he looks like a buff alien dude ready to get shit done with his bare hands, not some opera performer that's going home after their normal clothes got stolen..",3
He had at least a couple of them at that point,1
Could it be to promote the movie?,0
"Well y'know, he ran to take the hit to save someone else",1
Why would sony dump him? Sony are the ones who *wanted* him for spiderman. Disney wanted some other schmuck.,1

My question- In hindsight looking back at the first couple phases of the MCU is there anything you would change? Any characters you would've liked to introduce earlier or later on?",1
Because if I had war machine armor I would flaunt it al day. Rhodes has the right idea. Also is it just me or does it look like ultimate war machine armor a bit?,2

the other possibility is they did some misdirection cutting scenes and audio together. Maybe the scene of widow with short hair isn't the scene where scott shows up - they just wanted to use that look to keep her consistent throughout that first trailer.,2
Thor's behind Steve. He's also the only person TALLER than Steve. Def not Clint.,2
"I think it's more likely that their founding has extraterrestrial origins, which makes sense if their kingdom was handed the responsibility of guarding an Infinity Stone.

It was 1970. He would have had little reason to believe a daughter could grow up to be like him to have a career like that and thus have the chance to make the same mistakes he did.

Either that or if they just did a PERFECT KOTOR Trilogy one of those could be a winner. It s a lot like GOT in a way (could be done with a similar feel) and Revan is a fan-favorite figure that could easily be done in an epic manner.

I just wonder how Ultron knew that there was something like an infinity stone inside the scepter and then how he could have possibly held it without it hurting him (maybe because he's a robot and doesn't have a mind or flesh?) ,1

Could you recommend resources I could use to pursue the subject in my spare time? There are lots but with an untrained eye I'm unsure of where to start.",1

Not as much as you would think. It's not complete and the most valuable Signature is Stan Lee's.  Now if it had every signature and was the original prop used in the movies then it would be worth a massive amount.   It's probably worth the same amount as a nice car to the right collector.,1

It can. It's just expensive and not ideal for streaming to the masses. A typical blu ray movie is on a 50GB disc so assuming 2 hour length and max capacity on the disk you could stream it without loss of quality with 60Mb/s download speeds. It's just cheaper to compress it down to 2-4GB and stream it that way.,1

magic hasn't been seen on earth until 2011 when thor used the bifrost. the tesseract and weapons used in the first captain movie was probably covered up by shield and anyone else who saw this power was probably killed. nobody has mentioned captain marvel so the events in her movie were probably also covered up by the shield as well. the only people who know about the sorcerers are the sorcerers themselves.,1

My personal speculation is that maybe they are doing this on a by film basis meaning after ever film they will sit down and negotiate. Since theirs no guarantee the next film will make a billion dollars since it wont be coming after an Avengers movie. Seems like a lot of work but I hope this is whats happening since if the next spider-man makes less than a billion Disney's ask of 25  of profits may not hold up.,1

"Did you see a single tree, plant, flower, or blade of grass in any scene turning to dust?  No, you didn't.  Thanos made it clear he was fighting the overuse of resources, meaning the consumers... meaning us.   In fact... I didn't see a single dog or cat or flying bird vanish either.  Thanos was very specific in his task.",0
"Come to /r/boxoffice where this is being discussed daily.  Chances look good that it's going to eventually beat Avatar, possibly in 2 more weekends",1
No you're thinking of Benedict Cumberbatch,1
"Hey Kevin! Thanks for taking the time and surprising us with this. I have to ask, did you borrow the concept for Endgame from that Star Trek Voyager episode of the same name? Nobody has to know if you did, I won t tell anybody.",1
Fury is too,1
"I kinda wish he'd had it split between Loki's from various films, which would imply the time travel thing.",1
"Yeah, I think that it would be cool if they signed on and directed an episode or two. Why not?",3
Guardians of the galaxy was a good ensemble,2
"I don't know how they could've done it other than how they already kinda did in the middle. You could assume more was done offscreen, but any more than what they showed would seem a bit repetitive imo.",1
I'm really sorry for you bro. ,1
"kevin, i think your journey has been so cool. i m wanting to step more into creative direction roles in my field. do you have any advice for staying dedicated when it feels like nothing is moving forward quickly?  thanks!",1
Hate to say it but I'm guessing all of them. Would be one of the beats in the movie that help drive home how terrible this really is.,1
"Hi Kevin, Is Loki actually dead or did the >!time travelling in Endgame allow him to live?! ",1
"Hi Kevin! Is there any possibility of bringing in TV characters (Jessica Jones, the Punisher, Daredevil) into any of the future films (presumably after the Netflix 2 year moratorium is up)? Also, any chances of a Fantastic 4 reboot? Just want to say I'm very excited about the multiverse and its possibilities in the next phase. Thank you!",1
It was super different ,1
"Deadpool's first trailer was in August of 2015. Marvel/Sony partnership was officially announced in February. Yeah, there's the test footage, but that was entirely CGI, done by Blur. Might as well say it was influenced by the Marvel Ultimate Alliance cinematics where it happens, also done by Blur.",1
Didn t KF say they pick directors based on how passionate their pitch or idea is? If that s the case Marvel could possibly arrange and scale almost any comic passion project to fit into the MCU.  Idea + Marvel Sauce = B-b-b-bingo  Those pitch meetings would make the ultimate Blu-ray bonus feature in my opinion.,3
"Will there ever be another Hulk movie, but where She-Hulk gets introduced? Do you think a Spider-Man and Deadpool movie would do well in theaters?",1

"Naw it s a plot hole, it s a continuity problem that directly clashes with civil wars timeframe. The reason it s a plot hole is that they listed the time jump improperly in homecoming, probably not remembering the 2012 date",2
"Didn't Tom say that was the case? Also FFH spoilers, but a certain character in FFH is from a diff universe. Confirming that you can jump between",0

I don't know--stop askin' me the questions!,1
"The arch changes midway through season 1 because of the release of winter soldier. The whole show does a complete 180, and it takes off like a rocket. Well worth it.",1
I feel the same. Good to see  I'm not the only one. I was especially disappointed with Spider-Mans lack of screen time with his mask on in Infinity War. I also feel like the Deadpool movies show his too much.,1
"Oh, you are very welcome",2
"You know after thinking about it, I can definitely see Garfield as a college aged Peter, kinda like how he is in the 90 s cartoon, good point. ",1

Good for you. I m not okay with it. Cap s my favorite.,3
What if the severed hand of dp grew into colosuss's ideal version of dp that was cuffed with him in first movie,1

You missed the opportunity of saying sticking with his Gunns,1
Actually the first female one was black so uh nah. Take your diet racism elsewhere.,3
"I mean, only Cap got to  fuck up  Thanos a bit. Neither Thor nor Iron Man got a single hit. I'm serious, rewatch it, non of them except Cap manage to hit Thanos even once. Captain Marvel and ladies did get him good, but they're not OGs or even main characters of the movie.",1

Raccoon News!!!,1
It showed Scott though and he s fine. Maybe it s just photos of people they can t get in contact with. ,1
And its not even product placement at this point,1
That one didn t make sense to me. Was it some kind of meta joke?,1
"So a movie that was hyped up by 22 other movies over a 11 year span, and had several A list actors and countless special effects artists working on it, and whose story took place over a universal scale, just got past a stand alone boat film from the 90's.",0
"Nope, this is reddit",2
To the best of my knowledge. No spoilers at all really. ,1
That was my suspicion as well.,0
This is so well done. You are only missing the front zipper for fellatio.,1
"All of the GOTG cast stood by James Gunn actually, but Dave was the most vocal about his support. But yes, we should definitely be thankful to Dave because every time he used to say that he knows James and wouldn't let cyber Nazis ruin his career, it showed that he really meant that.",1
"The worst Marvel movies are, at its worst, watchable and serviceable. That's all you need to know about Marvel films at this point in its 10-year life. If it sucks, it won't be soul-suckingly bad. If it's awesome, you won't stop talking about it here once you've seen it. ",1
He didn't have to give one. You don't have to have an opinion on everything that exists.,1
Thank you for the acknowledgment rather than just downvoting me to hell!,2
I think it may be a set,3

"He was. He was lying about the number of parsecs, and the number of parsecs had nothing to do with how fast the Falcon is, which is what he was supposed to be boasting about.",1
I'm only slightly bitter that people are only calling for this kind of thing to stop when it happened to someone who leans left.  This kind of outrage culture has dogged a lot of people on the other side and there's never been this call for civility.  ,1

I love how a 4 month troll account is used to constantly spread negativity. If you were even a tiny fan of GOTG you'd know the message of second chances those movies kept showcasing.,3
So what no merits for originality why even bother then? If I m just gonna get copied by someone who couldn t be bothered to think of something themselves,1
Explain how Marvel is any worse? I'll wait....,1
Yeah you just zoomed over my head with that. I'm just gonna find a cheat table so I can look funkadelic even with shit stats.,1

"Fair point, as where I recognize the quality of season 5 and 6 I don t like them it. It took away from what made the show good and relied too heavily on the characters themselves. Also season 5 was so (visually) dark and that turns me off a tv show so much.",2
Spiderman: No Homo,1
Seriously ,1
Mother F : :  :    :     :      .     .       .        .        . You and Reddit did it!!,3
"It is subjective, I'll just clarify that I hold most of their films to be good. I'm not trying to make the mistake of cherry picking to prove my point, but the 22+ films in the MCU show some care in making movies. I scroll through Disney+ and even their non-franchise films are all pretty good, my family is a lot more excited to pick a movie now.",1
"he may have mastered invisibility, but his efforts sure weren't .. mastered... invisibly..? you know what i mean ",1
Zod has left the chat,2
I don t mind shorter season of episodes are long.,1
Child:  who the fuck are these guys ,3
"The time machine didn t add length to his life though, it just changed the time period he existed in. He was still the same age and (putting aside his sacrifice) still subject to the same death. Bill Gates documentary on Netflix oddly mentions the same thing. His assistant says that Bill is on time to all of his meetings because the one commodity he can t buy is time.",3
Loki has the teaseract!,1
" >Captain Marvel punching an old lady skrull. You don't know she's a Skrull, maybe she just hates seniors ",2
The spoilers are really minor compared to most trailers. ,1
"I would have liked the them leaving Gamora exiting in  it would have been more clear that she was not snapped (unless they wanted the uncertainty). I would like to know how she got off the planet, though...",1
"Crazy to think this isnt even it in the near future either. Deadpool likely has something, so does Blade. TV shows are being cancelled, but there is a possibility many of them get repurposed. Thunderbolts and Nova are 2 major properties being reported as in development.  MCU is only beginning, its nuts",1
"Disney+ looks better to me, but maybe looking at screenshots on a shitty smart phone isn t the best way to know?",1
IT'S THE ENDGAME KIDS,1
What do YOU mean  What do you mean you people ?,1
Sticking to his Gunns  ,2
I want to upvote this 3000,1
"Yeah, *X-Men* is the real jumping off point of the modern comic book movies as far as film is concerned.  Then *Spider-Man* came along in 2002 and pretty much took the genre to higher highs.  And I think it helped, to an extent, that Marvel had sold off so many of their film rights to different studios, so that so many more super hero films got put into production in the early-mid 00s.",3
I thought Paul Rudd said Tayne.,1
"She was horrendously miscast as Captain Marvel, which made a movie with a subpar script/director even worse. We needed an Emily Blunt type with serious charisma and humor :/ I love Marvel Studios but to Wait ten years for a female led superhero flick, and make one do profoundly mediocre, was a bummer.",0
I think they would have shown that jump if it happened like that...,1
Remember how upset and angry this sub was lmao. Of course a deal was going to get done,1
noone cares Lou. noone cares,2
James Gunn is one of the most well spoken directors working today,1
redditor for 27 days... nice try mickey mouse,1
"When Ant man said we met a few **years** ago ,I felt like a was a time traveler cause I didn't feel any of time going",1
"Can't wait to go see that movie by the open pedophile on twitter, what a joyous day to see him reinstated by Disney! Can't wait to take the kids too!",0
Looks like her helmet have the Mohawk on it. You can see it at 1:36.,2
"Hi Kevin, hope you re splendid!  My two favourite things in life are food and film, so... what is your favourite food, and what is your favourite film?  Great job on the MCU by the way, it was pure movie magic!",1
It looks more like Evangeline Lily,3
Mofo people mofo,1
Hope it doesn't suck.,1
LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPENEN,1
"This would make for a good parody edit of the trailer, actually.",2
I don't hate it but it's not among my all time favourites. I would definitely say that it's a bit overhyped these days.,0
"yea, be kinda awkward making her a lead Avenger if her origin story includes snapping an innocent ladys neck with a punch to the jaw over  mistaken identity.",3
This is one of those stories where nobody would ever believe you if they didn't have it on video.,1
Wow this is amazing,1
I think the view count is stuck at that number. I've refreshed the page quite a few times over the past half hour and it's not changed. Probably because the page is getting too much traffic for YT to keep up.,1
If you could go back and add any movie into phase one what would it be,1
"Wow, plus The cost of admission and parking and his time.  Retail of the shield should be like 10 K",1
Thanos can always steal the space stone and skedaddle without 1v1 ing Hela. I m sure Hela could wreck him tho. She doesn t die. She could maybe be defeated temporarily by the power stone but not for long.,2
"Has anyone considered that a big part of this movie might just be the (remaining) Avengers trying to kill Thanos as revenge? They all seem pretty pissed here, can t blame  em!",1
"Pretty sure MCU Peter isn't keeping it a secret either, not well at least. I hope there is a post credits scene where it is revealed that Hannibal Burress's gym teacher character was the first one to find out but just didn't tell anyone because having a superhero in his class was dope.",1
 Are those sigs real or printed?,2
"Honestly a little disappointed by this. I mean sure, we all knew he wasn't going to die on the ship, but why play up this whole  stranded  story arc in both major trailers just to show off that he makes it home just fine. ",1
That was awesome. My favorite part is when cap throws the shield to himself and then again at himself,1
"I have always just assumed that he s going to be in WandaVision as Simon Williams, a celebrity who takes interest in Wanda.",1
"Hello, Mr. Feige! If you could revive an actor for another role in the franchise, who d be your go to guy or gal?",1
"Come again, love?",3
Can confirm I was definitely thinking so the heck what? throughout most of the video,1
Thor also has a ton of room for growth. Rune King Thor is the strongest Avenger.,3
"Go to bed when it s time to go to bed, them!",1
What is your favorite non-Marvel comic?,2
"I wasn't going to go on reddit today but people comparing this to GL in the YT comments and other sources is just astounding. Why. This is nothing like that movie, origin, or series. Sorry as a fan who read the comics first then the movies I'm a bit frustrated.",1
"Without revealing any details, are there any specific characters that you re particularly interested in adding to the MCU?",1
Not on my watch,1
Never in a million years would I have guessed this would happen. Holy crap this is awesome.,1
I read this as a trump tweet,2
Well it is actually a guy(martian).  Basically a superman clone.  Dies replaced by other various people over the years some female some guys. I know nothing about ms.marvel or when she became captain marvel who this movie is about,2
"Oh ffs, now I want this to be real. Thanos is just sitting there reversing time and replaying the trick over and over and over again trying to see how it's done. Tony: Uh....aren't we supposed to be fight -  Thanos: IN A MINUTE!!",3
"I'm not sure which part you're referring to.  I wouldn't say that there were zero team-up attacks in Endgame, by the way.  Thor blasts Iron Man to charge him up.",1
It is Reddit we're speaking about here,1
"WITH HIS NEW FRIEND, A WASTE OF PARTS. WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE.",3
"Just realised: aside from Nat and Steve, and Nat and Clint, none of the Avengers are shown sharing the screen! I really hope they keep that stuff out of the next trailer (and the TV spots).",1
"I didn't realize this until you comment, but I really look forward to the documentary of this phase of the MCU in like 2 years.",2
"You're calling my opinion incorrect.  I think yours is wrong. You think mine is wrong. Only one side of this seems to care what the other thinks and it's not me, so I don't understand why you all care what I think so badly.",0
I love how smoothly Rocket transitions into being an Avenger.,3
"Does anyone know whether or not Marvel will release the footage they showed at the SDCC during Hall H?  Like they have descriptions, but I really wish I could actually see it.  Espically the Black Widow teaser.",1
"just cos half the populations gone doesn't mean that the snap did it equally, for example the whole of Britain could be gone whilst Texas remains untouched, New york's empty but New Zealand's full of people... People may even have abandoned the city after it happened for some reason...",3
Oh most definitely. I'm very excited for those movies. I'm gonna try to convince him not to skip them,1
"I fucking hate Donald Trump and I support James being fired. That's the thing, some of us hold the same standards regardless of any political or social affiliation.  What gets me is that so many are defending this shit that would have lost their minds if Trump did it.",1
What does it say? ,1
Peter was saved by Deadpool when he warned Peter to go home. I'm still hoping too that the X Force will return with Peter,2
"I seem to remember him saying the same. Basically  as long as they'll let me, and my body can handle it, I'm in. ",3
Black Widow could arguably pass as an Infinity Saga movie.,2
Hopefully is pulls out his wallet that says bad motherfucker on it.,1
"As someone who is friends with someone very, very close to him and hears about him a lot, those comments are so frustrating. People have it in their heads that he's an actual rapist and pedophile. I think it's one thing to joke about it (though we really shouldn't) and actually BE one.",2
He d have to make them shrink/unshrink without it being obvious though. Probably harder than the magic he already does. ,2

It would be better if the kid was dressed up as the devil.,1
Yipee,1

You didn't mention Loki who was also killed in action. (I assume that's what KIA stands for?),3
When you got your start on the first X-Men movie did you even envision in your wildest dreams that you would be one of the main people in charge of such a successful interconnected Marvel universe?,1
Because sony wanted to negotiate but disney wasn't having anything fair to each company.  All the people such as yourself trying to push the blame onto sony are doing exactly as disney wants you to do by being rabid fans creating pressure.,1
"I first saw Evans in Cellular. I was about 16-17 and I didn't know what a good movie was yet. He seemed like such a hero in that movie though. Rando ass good samaritan with a nokia phone, doing whatever it took to save that hot milf from Jason Statham.",2
So which company won? Disney got an additional 25  correct? Whereas before they only had merchandising?,1
"Shit man, I thought I had finally put all this behind me...",1
"That was such a great scene. That movie made me cry, I hope Avengers End Game will have a happy ending. No more deaths please! ",1
"Pretty sure it'll be in the movie too. (*cut to March 2019*)  Where's the pager? We were promised a pager, motherfucker ",3

Hello I would like to know what MCU film is your favourite?,1
I mean... i cried watching that Stan Lee opening   Captain Marvel. It was like someone stabbed me over and over with emotion knife. so... sad. :(,1
"With the Netflix shows being cancelled, Marvel may be eyeing a reboot for those characters anyway. Aside from Daredevil I wasn't much of a fan so I would be ok with that. Would much rather see them in their own solo movies rather than a TV show",1
"I'm going based on what the source article says.  If it changes or is clarified, then so be it.",1
Hawkeye = Thanos getting his purple ass getting handed to him. Can't wait to cry when Iron Man and Cap leave or die.,1
"If you had to pick one word to describe your life after the MCU began, which would you pick?",1
"Yup, ran that show straight into the ground.",2
It takes whatever,1
"I think Tony is talking to Pepper s helmet. He says I ll think about you which could be either referring to the other avengers (more likely) or possibly to Pepper Potts. She may have had a safety plan incase Tony was gone for a certain amount of time and her suit brought her up to save him, but died trying.",0
Not being able to afford the taxes on one's home after techbros take over the neighborhood is far more fucked up.,3
"This is the problem with nitpicking time travel. Cap could have simply gone to before she was married, end of discussion. Trying to fill in every gap is a fools errand.",1
Thank you for realizing this! I said the same to my friend and he was adamant that it wasn t a nod to the Necrosword.,1
at least we got the stealth suit back,3

Still got them bussies,2
Or not? This is the third sony-marvel deal. Each on was only for a few movies.,1
LOL at Ant-Man and Hawkeye's existences.,1
It s all I see,2
"No it's not. It's no different for having a preference for your potential partners preference for cats or dogs. Grow up. And don't act like your some holier than though figure. We all judge everyone on everything, it's almost instinctual, pretending you don't doesn't make you better than everyone else, it makes you a dick.",1
Not sure where the pedophile bit comes from.  Notice how I said neither of what you mentioned ?,0
I mean. It's not that's a huge surprise. ,1
Did you not watch Infinity War? Hulk was too scared to fight Thanos again after getting his ass kicked.,0
"They could easily have Deadpool tell the audience  they re here now in the MCU, fucking deal with it, we ve done enough origin films, it s time to break that MCU X Men virginity fuckers.  And trust me, we re going in hard. ",1

"Wow. I can almost hear Tony on the verge of scolding that robot arm, well done!",2
"I agree, a young avengers movie would need his star power.",3
"Whelp I probably should have watched Infinity War before watching that trailer, oh well.",1
"Read my edit, I was half joking. The more lucrative option is to renegotiate so both parties benefit from good films that make over a billion each. Sony was aready planning on making at least 2 more films with Marvel, likely to cover phase 4 and 5 in 2021 and 2023. I assume they possibly will just resume those projects. Not sure about the other projects Sony has, but these are the important ones.",1
"Fair, I'm just much more excited for other two projects out next year. I'm just getting older and it's only natural after a decade the excitement will start to peter out. I'm sure they'll all be competent and well made, you have to wonder what it's like for a non-Marvel fanatic though.",1

"> well actually lol really?  > When a organisation reviews a movie, its generally only got one person's name on the review despite there being tens or hundreds of employees. so those tens or hundres of employees should get the credit for the review what one employee ultimately writes? do you think each magazine or website gets their own seperate screening, and then all the employees get together in a conference and decide how to review the movie? and you call me naive? lol you gullible fool ",0
Agreed.  Secondary characters like Foggy and Karen have more and better characterization than ANY of the movie characters.,3

"Well it has been a year, so maybe they just haven't mentioned it. They didn't show enough of the general public life to say one way or another. It's odd that it hasn't come up but I can see them dropping a hint of it in later episodes that were written after more Endgame details were available to the writers. The fact that none of the 7 or so original team members got snapped is a coincidence the same way the Homecoming cast all getting snapped is a coincidence.",1
Well no family is perfect ,3
don't you dare!!!!!!!!,2
Hi Kevin!  Here are my questions: 1. For how long did you know that the Infinity saga was going to end like this? Had you planned since Avengers 1 that it would end with Thanos and the death of the avengers that died in the movie (i dont want to spoil :-))? 2. How do you see the MCU for the next years? Do you plan doing a big team up movie like the avengers?,1

Dude that was 4 years ago. I m not defending Sony but management has changed and they don t have an umbrella of characters quite like Marvel does. They re different beasts.,0

I don't see why they can't do both. They already did it with Deadpool 2. R-rated initial theatrical release followed by a PG-13 theatrical re-release followed by a PG-13 Disney+ release.,1
In the comics Carol might be immortal. I read on a comic book website about all her powers and she has a faster healing factor than wolverine and could probably be immortal in the comics. In the mcu I m not sure. Probably but not likely. I think it s more likely her altered DNA means that she ages incredibly slow and heals faster. Add to that her invulnerability granted by the space stone she ll be almost impossible to kill unless someone tampers with her powers like the Kree did.,1

I'm well aware of that.  But Marvel fired him for those things because PC reactionaries (both sides) got upset and followed suit in wanting him fired.

"Yeah, in the novel that was meant to be established MCU canon, he had mutations at birth. Purple was the color of death on Titan. He was super intelligent, big, and strong, so they were obviously scared shitless of him.

We know Vision is probably going to lose the stone so it makes sense if Vision is imitating Cap, loses, gets killed for the stone and Thanos says that.   But I'm also expecting Iron Man and Cap to both die in this so it could be any of those three in my book.  ",1

The Box office sales amount to about a quarter of what gets made in Merchandise sales of the Average comic movie. Disney made 41 billion in 2013 of Licensing, thats waaaaaay more then they made in Ticket sales at the Time.",1
The Russo s just kinda chuck out everything they personally don t care about telling away and do their own thing.  Which is fine. Except it results in them breaking and bastardizing the better parts of other people s movies in order to fit their blander style.  That being said I d take civil war any day over infinity war.

Well yeah he also looked like that in the movie. They also knew he didn't want to stay in the mcu so probably didn't push too hard on him.

Disney knows more about manipulating media than Russia. ",0

Maybe I'm wrong on this but ethically I can't imagine even James Gunn would want that.  There's a ton of people counting on this project being made and as much as I'm sure the cast would want to help Gunn out and stand up for him they also probably don't want to be the reason a bunch of people are out of jobs until this gets settled.

Right now Sony but Disney is offering to pay the expenses for half the profit.  Which seems reasonable for a few seconds until you realize that a Spiderman movie is guaranteed profit.

"I know I m going to get shit on in this sub, but the marvel movies aren t the same as cinematic classics. They are great, fun movies, but comparing them to amusement parks is pretty dead on. They are meant to spoon feed us what we want and not get too complicated out of fear of losing a few ticket sales. Compared to the Nolan Batman s they are kids stuff. I am a fan of the marvel movies though.",3
"Watch out, Cap! That's the Soviet Mind Game!",1
spooderman,1
"How hard is it to make something that continually surpasses even the highest expectations from fans? Every movie seems to be bigger and better than the last.  In phase 4 do you plan on reeling it in and getting more grounded to build back up, or just continue to make these giant spectacle blockbuster movies?",1
A lot of people think casting directors just schedule auditions or negotiate contracts. But it's really a lot of work and takes skill and talent. Sarah Finn is a master.,3
"I think the going theory is that TV Loki either ends up in the MCU prime and replaces his alternate self, or he takes our Loki s place so he can survive.",1
"You're right, my mistake. Fixed.",2
Roseanna was actually racist. Gunn isn't actually a paedophile (probably).,0
If they ever even go to quite that same scale again. I doubt it ll ever be quite as massive of an event as infinity war/endgame. Obviously still something important like a secret war or secret invasion... something along those lines. But just maybe not like a 2 parter across 2 years .,3
So how long do you have premium for?,1
Hi all.  Just passing through!,1
"You are an actual God, it blows my mind how you manage to make this transitions, love your work, keep it up and good luck!",1
This is the best thing I've ever seen...until I see the movie.,1
What did it feel like finally getting Spider-Man in the MCU (and the FOX properties),1
"I hate Pepper, she ruins this whole thing for me. Get your ugly stupid mug off there.",0
Don't put Endgame on the list.  Once they watch Infinity War as the 8th movie they'll naturally want to see what happens in Endgame.   So they'll watch 9,1
"It got me real good, man. I was certain it was real.",1
Two minutes would already be quite a stretch for him.,3

"Hi Kevin, firstly, thank you so, so much for everthing. MCU is a part of my life that I can never be separated from. No question. Just wanted to say this.",1
The CGI was actually good the only main problem with it was near the end of the movie (everyone overreacts as if all of the CG in the movie was bad),1
They met each other at the beginning of the movie. CM saved Tony and blue alien from dying in space.,1
"So, if I turn up the brightness level, then I can watch Disney+ quality without the subscription prices!!!",1
Or it s small and sticking straight out.,1
AS GOD IS MY WHITNESS SPIDEY IS BROKEN IN HALF !,1
"Why is Avatar the highest grossing film of all time though, like for real? I'm not trying to be rude or ignorant, I'm genuinely confused as to how it's the highest grossing film of all time. Especially when compared to masterpieces like Titanic and Endgame.  I tried watching the movie a couple years back, and I literally couldn't even finish it. It was so bad in my opinion. What's so special about it?",1
Disney money*,2
"I'm not quite sure how you arrived where you did, but let me try to rephrase what the above commenter was saying: Bigotry is something that's taught. As a young child ignorant of all of the context, I missed all of the racial connotations and just thought he was a nice guy that I would like to have as an uncle. It's actually a very positive message - kids just don't hate the way adults do. Not until they're told they should.",3
I knew it could do it. Whatever it takes,1
Is Captain Marvel a vegan like Envy?  That would explain the super-powers. (Ha),3
Guessing it was intentionally hilarious,3
Oh man... those kids are never getting to school on time again. ,3
"Exactly. The only reason these films exist is to make money. Blockbusters aren t inherently bad, but Marvel films aren t even really films. They re products. Or as Scorsese would say, theme parks.",1

"The accuracy of the characters  portrayals re: the comics is almost entirely unimportant to me, but that Colossus is one of my favorite superhero movie characters ever. He is a delight.",3
Yeah so far,2
"Hey Kevin, x200B Huge fan of Marvel and the MCU. You truely created something amazing. Thank you so much! x200B What are the odds of our Marvel Netflix heroes (and villains) making it to the big screen? I've read some articles where you stated you wanted to keep the MCU it's own entity but with the cancellation of the shows on Netflix, and the introduction of the multi-verse, has that thought changed?",1
"Possibly not. We saw that the only two survivors on Titan were ones that he promised to soare, Nebula and Stark. I feel like he actively targeted every hero on Titan because it would have been unlikely for every one of them to be dusted. If Peter stayed on Earth it's possible he would have been a part of the living 50 .",1
"Does anyone find it interesting how when cap is tightening his strap to his shield, his arm/hand is trembling? I m curious as to why? Is he fearful of something or is it those  I can do this all day  moments while some weapon is impales through his body and his trembling is from immense pain.  Also, maybe I shouldn t take it too seriously, I m wondering if a lot of these scenes or just misdirection scenes",1
And Guardians 3 is gonna have a similar if not longer gap than Doctor Strange.,1

"Can confirm, my ex worked on a movie set with him recently, said he was the nicest famous person she's ever met. They ended up staying until 4am and he thanked everyone at the end. ",1

I'm excited to see that other guy in the background's crazy looking portly mustached Spectacular Spider-man movie in four years.,1
Which superhero do you feel is most undervalued by fans in the MCU.,2
"Disney makes 100  of merchandises, which brings in way more money than the movies",3
Why would they cut this scene??? This is absolutely amazing and would have made the ending even more heart-wrenching   Also I love how Doctor Strange is the only one who is alone in one shot because it shows that he knew Tony was going to die and he shows his respect towards him for actually pulling through the 1 in 14 million chance.,1
"Geez man, what did Pam do to deserve to be Captain Marvel?",1
Hopefully somehow the blue shield makes a return too. ,3
My balls are drained too,1
You look amazing.,1
My brother-in-law does a lot of concrete work. I like to call it cement just to watch his eye twitch.,1
"After all these Thor movies. I think Chris is just officially now Thor Hemsworth. After this is all done and he's moved on from the character I hope him and his brother muck about on youtube n full Thor and Loki be cosplay. After fully converting Thor over to his prankster lifestyle, Loki and Thor go around pulling pranks on humans like all those other prank YouTube  series. Can you imagine, this would be YouTube gold! Fucking viral antics up the ass! ",1
I really should have stayed off twitter for a while. I read so many comments in the cast s posts that many fans have been saying they were disappointed because their favorite actor/actress defends a bad person like James Gunn. ,1
"Hey Kevin, big fan of your work. Do you anticipate adding the X-Men and/or Fantastic 4 during phase 4? Or using phase 4, and the more cosmic storylines, as a way to bring them in for phase 5? x200B P.S. Would love to see the Russo's direct a Fantastic 4 movie with John Krasinski as Mr. Fantastic.... just throwing that out there. Thanks for your time!",2

Hi your a good person,1
Could even be the government who set Scott up with a home for his house arrest. The optics of someone who was arrested for standing up for freedom by the side of Captain America living in squalor would be bad for the pro-Accords government. The government would want to make sure that they weren t seen as treating the Avengers poorly.,1
I don't owe you anything. ,0
I did. 2 weeks ago he said they told him he has a year and he can see the movie like the rest of us. ,3

For some people they were hooked 5 eps in. For many it was about halfway when winter soldier was released. For a few seasons now it's honestly one of the best shows on tv. It picks up fast when it really hits its stride in season 1,1

He was pretty serious in civil war.,1
For the record this was his plan.,1

It ll be a prequel,3
"Thanks!  Nite, y'all, this was fun!",2
"Hahah that s fair, and sorry if I came off rude  it genuinely sucks that you went through that. I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right (you were), yet to fail (/be downvoted) nonetheless.",1
Yeah because you have to have both eyes open and fight some snakes on a plane and be a jedi in the meanwhile,1
"And full of people  defending  Disney between two of their own products. . You should care because you might have a preference that you otherwise wouldn't have known you cared about.

Oh wow an actual cosplay and not a body suit  cosplay  good for you!!!!,1

Oscar the Grouch wouldn't show up. ,1
"Hello Kevin! Truly admire your work. You ve managed to successfully string together 22 separate movies that follow the same story + characters, all helmed by different creative teams. My question to you is: how involved are you in the writing process for each of the independent films?

So sad after hearing the news. Rest easy Stan. ,1
"He was, but you cant expect the Avengers to react this fast, now had the fight lasted alot longer, then you could expect the Avengers to actually pop out.",1
Poor Hemsworth.   He was getting the short end of the stick until recently.,1
But why,1
"I would've loved to have Ross interacting with Bruce during the funeral scene. According to Feige, Betty was snapped, so he owes it to Bruce that he has his daughter again. Besides, the world has changed so much since the time he spent tormenting Bruce to boost his career from the Hulk formula. His role in Civil War shows that despite still being a hard-ass, he's not as unreasonable as he used to be. That health scare probably has something to do with it.",1
"It's pretty astounding to me to see the manchildren here so excited about some boring, soulless, fanfiction capeshit movie.",0

A few asterisks away from being on a whole different sub,2
"Why would Natasha retire with someone else's family? Hawkeye has been the most adjusted Avenger since AoU, it was until Endgame that he started to do questionable stuff. Natasha on the other hand learned to be a team player and thrived as an Avenger. It makes way more sense for her to sacrifice herself, rather than to try to tack on a complex arc to Hawkeye and give Black Widow his ending",2
"Drax was wildly unhelpful in IW as well, what's your point?",1
"The rumor of the cocaine usage pictures being the real reason for the firing makes this letter seem like the people who signed it, know more than the public does or just know Gunn better than the public.

Mickey Mouse fucking a piece of cheese in an old cartoon should also make Mickey be removed forever",0

"I think Steinfeld looks the part (the concept art they recently released looks fantastic) and is an incredibly talented actress with plenty of range. Just because the awkward outcast is her usual typecast doesn't mean she can only play that character.

"That's a great catch. I saw the movie in the theater so many times that eventually I was actually wondering why they seemed to linger for a second too long on this shot for it to just be a  let's do this  type of look. Now it makes sense... the nod right before they take off is the  let's go , the other like 2 seconds just prior is them sharing the moment of her acknowledging that she's an Avenger.",1

"Somewhat topical, but this is my opinion of Endgame. Infinity War just sets the stage so fucking well and Endgame, while not bad, just can't compete because there's a natural lack of suspense and tension knowing it's the finale. Infinity War is the culmination of over 10 years of hard work, while Endgame is the culmination of Infinity War.",1

What man? All I see is a black background.,1
Pleasantly surprised,1
"Well its pretty obvious that he meant Tom Holland s version of spiderman, but thanks for pointing it out",1
I second this question.,2
THANKYOU!!! finally someone said it! ,0
"> her Spider-Man is perfectly fine and he's been way more exposed than Wolverine ever has to be fair people really didnt want Peter Parker for the MCU, they wanted Miles Morales. People do want a little fresh meat on the scene. We want same, but different. Rogue, Storm, or Jubille as main characters are great ideas",0
Do you like Ham or Turkey on your sandwich?,1
"Star Lord, man. Legendary Outlaw?",1
you look like him too dang,1
Is it me or does her body not match the suit. I think the costume design team fucked that up. Something off.,1
Thanos was also a nobody to the people on earth until IW. Nobody knew that it was Thanos who sent Loki in 2012.,1
"Yep, everybody knows the copyright laws are Mickey Mouse s age plus 15 years.  That s what I love about these copyright laws. I get older but they stay the same age. ",3
"I can think of a million better ways to promote a movie, but it is weird she's on that side of the counter...",2
Except Doctor Strange can visit the subatomic realm with magic (he flew through it on his trip). ,3
"Suddenly, I'm coughing blood, my head is going to explode, my heart hurts, I contracted Ebola, my mom didn't vax me, I have head, eyes, mouth, ass, dick, hand and hair cancer, can someone call the Marvel execs so this dying person can see Endgame too?? I promise I'll die when it ends... ",1
they make pills for that.,1
He s crying because he had to shave off his beautiful beard.,2
I am so fucking glad. I couldn't imagine GOTG without him. ,1
I d love to see a bit of an origin/backstory for Thanos on screen,2
locks dece. Guess more popcorn for me.,0
This man will live on in infamy for all he has done. May he rest in peace and protect the universe with his never ending watch.,1
you're probably right but also probably the kind of person I'd avoid hanging around or talking about anything with,1
Not a chance. Gunn has to do The Suicide Squad first,2
I knew Russo would lie about the title. Mofos  Endgame was uttered by Strange in Infinity War and it is not remotely close to  forever ! Kevin lied too. Endgame is not a spoilerific title. Edit: anyway congrats my bro and sis. We made it to the trailer alive. Woohoo!,3
I'm laughing at what looks like Scott marching in line and making someone else (Bruce?) carry his Ant-Man suit behind him.  Someone correct me if I'm misinterpreting.,1
"Hi Kevin! Thank you for taking the time out of your day to do this! If you could hang out with one MCU character, who would it be?",1
This sounds like it'd just be a larger scale version of the audition scene from Mystery Men.,1
I kinda feel scared to watch the movie,3
AHHHHH!!!! WE GET JJJ AGAIN!!!!,2
And teach evil steph curry a lesson. ,1
u/the asian hamster get on this,1
"But this literally happened before, Banner said he killed himself by putting a gun in his mouth  but he spit the bullet out. ",3
Leftists have no standards.,0
No Gillan too,0
Looks like that flash montage at the beginning is everyone who got snapped by Thanos.,0
"Damn, as a European I wasn't awake when the AMA started :/  My question would be this one: **In Infinity War Thanos states he will do the snap every few billion years to balance the universe. What made him change his mind between Infinity War and Endgame because in Endgame he contradicts himself and says he meant only to do it once and then destroy the stones.**",1
"It's still very possible, although not from Insomniac of course. Before it was settled that Spider-Man would be the game, they actually gave Insomniac freedom to choose whatever character they wanted as long as it was X-Men. Spider-Man just made the most sense coming off of Subset Overdrive's traversal system.",1
Spider-Man: Homeward Bound.,1
That's an awfully meta argument for an in universe decision. Strange has the time stone  why would he ever not use it for this exact purpose?,2
Then we gonna have recaps of infinity war from him. Please please,1
Suuuuure buddy Because normal people put that much effort into a woosh comment and it s definitely not you backtracking or anything,1
Who s gonna be the next Iron Man?,1
This is all Disney greed.,1
https://i.imgur.com/uC7sIE0.jpg,3
because the shows are interesting and fun to watch?,1
I'd love to hear a rant with JJJ blaming Spider-Man for the whole Disney/Sony debacle.,2
Thanos isn't even the strongest villain we've seen so far in the mcu. That honour goes to Hela.  And he's definitely not going to be the strongest as the likes of doom and company are on their way.,2
"True but I would liked to have seen the finale to the hulk arc over the last 3 movies where he hulks out in the battle and Banner now has control over man and beast.  Instead of Captain Marvel, it should have been the rematch with Thanos.  It should have been the glorious fight we were waiting expecting and they could have still used the same conclusion where Thanis has to hit him with the power stone to get an advantage.",1
Cool. I'm not the only one who thought that.,3
at least we have wonder woman which avoided all of that and looks like WW84 will bring back all the nostalgia of 80s instead of depending on one or two clips of 90s aesthetic that they so desperately needed to... check,1
"Hi Lord Feige, thank you for doing this AMAA - and for everything else! The most easiest question: What is your favourite meme format from the MCU films?",0
I love it that we're getting a lot of Hawkeye. In the trailer at least. ,1
"Not a huge fan of that movie, but I thought he nailed it.",3
The Cap one is really made up.,3
"God the hype is real, everything about it looks dope as fuck",1
Yay!  ,1
"Charlie, you fucking killed it. You brought a grit and weight, anger, intensity, guilt, shame, and epic fucking physicality to the role. Season one and three have been some of my favorite seasons of TV ever. (Loved season 2 also). Your boiling rage underneath rooted the character in his heart and goals. The show will be so missed. Thanks for an amazing, nuanced performance.",3
I agree. The music always gets me though  ,1
He was incredibly selfish. He turned his friends into criminals and forced his other friends to be responsible for hunting them down. He turned his back on half of the Avengers because he thought it was the right thing to do when it really wasn t.,1
Switch the Marvel for Disney,1
I believe it's a leafs reference when they blew the lead to the Bruins ,0
Lol right? I haven t seen one reply yet,1
Wow this interviewer is terrible.,1
>while in a thread with Kevin Feige and ignoring that many Marvel writers and directors participate in this forum,2
Does Spider-Man: Far From Home conclude the Infinity Saga or both the Infinity Saga and Phase 3?,1
"Venom and Into the spiderverse share producers, the same producers also worked on homecoming and far from home. I'm not sure where you get the idea that the sony team is terrible. If you mean they have different directors, then say directors and not  execs   --- whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.",1
"Being a plot device is kind of a waste for someone of Portman's caliber. Jane Foster was more or less just chauffered around Asgard, 'everyman'ing for the audience. The intern in TDW could have just as easily been the vessel for the Aether. And the film would still have worked. I think Marvel has all kinds of opportunities to get more into their characters now. Before you know it, there will be an Oscar winning performance in the MCU.",3
Let people not enjoy things.,1
Kinda but not really. They re not really self aware. ,1
It's entirely possible,1
Cap doesn't miss chest day,1
"I'm not worried to know who it is, I'd like to be surprised, but do you know who the next Big Bad for the MCU is?",1
Well of course! If she didn't write that she'd have been fired! You know who didn't write that? Peter Strzok!,0
Its Disneys fault guys! They own marvel studios and wanted more money from the films even though Sony pump more money into the films. Sony arent the bad guys here. Disney bad.,1
"Second one cause she said that was the more comfortable of the two and she didn t like how the first one was so framed around showing her cleavage. Plus it just looks cool, I d be down for making the cape effect more pronounced.",3
"Game of Thrones has Gendry, Marvel Cinematic Universe has Tony Stark.",2
I think she is was just miscast along with marvel clearly not knowing who her character is supposed to be. It turns out  strong woman  isn't really a personality,0
"I do enjoy it, that's why I know the lore. I was just pointing something out it seems you were mistaken about. Don't get mad.",2
Because there's like six people with that bandwidth and it doesn't justify the investment.,1
"the problem with writing Captain Marvel is that the character was mostly flat to begin with  after Whiz Comics got sued by DC for making *their* Captain Marvel look too much like Superman in 1953, Marvel Comics snagged the name from the public domain and had to slap together a superhero from it so they wouldn t lose the copyright.  That s also why the Captain Marvel power set is kind of generic too. The name preceded the character instead of the other way around.",2
"On the topic of LGBTQ representation in the MCU, and that the Russo's statement that a closeted gay character already exists in the MCU. There's a lot of speculation about who this is, and a lot of it falls on Brie Larson's Captain Marvel, but based on her personality I really feel she would be asexual, rather than gay. Thoughts on that and more representation in the MCU? P.s. I look forward to more representation like Joe Russo's character: natural, unforced, and not the butt of a joke.",1
Can someone explain? Are they dropping Tom holland?,1
Also the Russo s have said that fat Thor is the strongest Thor yet (Which is stupid imo).  Source: https://www.tigerdroppings.com/rant/movie-tv/russo-bros-say-thor-was-stronger-than-ever-at-the-end-of-endgame/84874486/,0
"Oh, yeah, no doubt. But, it would be hilarious is there was a new Colossus, but every time Wade interacts with him, from his POV it's the Deadpool movies Colossus",3
"I'd say technically, they ignore the show more than anything. Also, he literally died on screen and that didn't stop him from coming back but he dies off screen on the show and everyone wants to consider him gone for good? Ok then....",1
"Remember this: You don't have to go large-scale every movie. The occasional big team-up to tackle a huge threat is fine, but if the world is threatened every time, it's going to feel like the world just can't manage itself for one   minute. Likewise, stakes that are bigger than the world will rapidly grow stale. Who cares about the difference between the world burning and the entire solar system blowing up? Neither one is acceptable losses. Except in Thor 3...which handled it well.",1
We've dealt with ABC Inhumans. We can handle a little Venom.,1
Is down voting for balance like all things should be a good thing at the moment? Asking for a Thanos. In all seriousness I love what this community is doing for a fellow MCU fan,1
"I swear if when the Guardians are fighting and moody teenager Groot refuses, I will piss myself",1
"Hey fair point i didn t realize it was that quick. But my original point still stands. All that person is doing is putting something that already exists somewhere else, and he s getting a crazy about of gold and whatever else they added I m not up to date. That s all man.",1
I don't think we're likely to see that. They're more likely to bring Killmonger back than they are Klaue.,2
The Russos  justification for not including the Hulk/Banner union is because it was too victorious a moment for a movie like IW. But I feel like having a victorious moment like that only to have it all fall apart at the end with the snap anyway would have made it even more emotionally resonant....not really sure what happened there.,3
"Kevin, it's an honor to have you here. What is the biggest regret you have from the MCU up to this point? Obviously there are lots of  what if  scenarios, but I mean something you might have lost sleep over.  Thanks for all you and the team do!",1
"So...the part from  May  God have mercy on  ...  to the end of that particular paragraph. If you decide to post this again, you might wanna cut this out. Although I understand the sentiment, it sounds very /r/iamverybadass . However everything else was nice to read. :)",2
Dacre is the perfect Gambit I think!,1
I am just worried about the kid with the terminal disease he is bout to visit,1
"Hope she hires the best stuntpeople, none of that quick cam shit please.",1
4 movies a year is crazy though. Quality over quantity,0
Same thing with Dr. Strange.,3
I really thought I would be done with the MCU way back when they did the big announcement at SDCC with Phase 3... yet here I am... still giddy with excitement. I love this guy... AND THIS MEANS MORE KORG!,1
This.  Is quite adorable.,1
"Ah man.  95 though, he lived a long, full life.  We should all be so lucky.  RIP edit: hopefully he got to see a cut of A4 ",3
With over 650 upvotes in a couple hrs I d say it s pretty rated,3
It was actually Tayne,1
"Well deserved, honestly. I've enjoyed every single panel of your work.",2
"He acts like an asshole to them, the whole time and leaves as soon as he realizes he s won t get paid for joining them, big difference there and no comparison to Stark at all",1
Goodspeed. ,1
 Me (url) rewatching the trailer,2
"All disney owned marvel movies are on disney+ here (Netherlands), so everything from Iron man to endgame, only excluding Hulk and Spider-Man 1 2.",3
"Those kids don t seemed to be surprised or know who the actors are, otherwise they would have a bigger reaction.",3
>Galactus is coming. >>Who? *Avengers theme plays*,1
 And I'm gonna need that guy's arm *Bucky glares*,1
"I meant one that rivals old Asgard, not a broke down fishing village.",0
They did at least use his small form for 'going inside' tony stark.,1
"So when do you think Moon Knight, She-Hulk, and Ms. Marvel will premiere?",2
Insane !,1
What did you do...? ***WHAT DID YOU DO?!***,3
People started applauding in the theater I was after the first hole. They were not ready for what followed.,1
I dunno. I think they're just going to use the Guardian's ship to fly in space. That's the vibe I'm getting from the poster at least.  No one on the team even knows what the quantum realm is except for Scott(and maybe Carol??? Does she in the MCU?) so I feel like they might just fly or summon the bifrost. ,3
"Any more credible source than TMZ? I don't see it mentioned on any of the news sites, so I'm crossing my fingers that this is just bad reporting.  Edit: I'm seeing it covered in more places now. Wishful thinking on my part I guess. RIP Stan, you will be missed.",1
"I m not going to be terribly upset if it s a prequel, given that she has a lot of backstory to work with, but **anyone** can be brought back to life in a comic book story.",1
"I won t be awake when this goes live but all I want to say is thank you Kevin and the whole Marvel team for bringing these characters to life in such an amazing way. You have done the impossible and got me as well as many others through difficult times in our lives. This franchise has impacted so many people and we re all grateful. Once again, thank you Kevin and everyone at Marvel who works tirelessly to bring us these incredible stories.  P.s. Give us Dr Doom",1
Ultron being brought back confirmed,3
r/birthofasub,1
Now THIS is the scene they should ve put with the re-release,1
"That walking scene is dope. Though, there's clearly space between Scott and Rhodey for either Captain Marvel or Tony, and there's someone/thing directly behind Rhodey I can't quite place.",1
>  He consistently made fun of pedophilia. And of other taboo topics. Because that's what his job was at the time. Amazing the  mental gymnastics (url) that people must go through to come up with that.,1
HAS ANYBODY SEEN DRAX?? WE HAVE SOME WONDERFUL NEWS FOR HIM,1
"It's fun probably because they can goof around, plus the amount of zanyness from Taika probably didn't seem so dull at all.",1
"So many posts Scott, i close my eyes and i can still see them. We removed them all, theyre gone, every single one of them... and not just the reposts, but the shitposts and memes too,",1
What a sheep. We were talking about his writing. Lost an argument? Bye. Also that Granny's peach tea was hysterical. Whoever shu Its on it I assume he is a sheep. Better than anything Loki or Vulture has ever done,0
50  Yikes!,0
Mine doesn t arrive until next week does it come with digital copies of the movies?,3
"Disney got 20  more of dollar one, it was all a negotiation.",1
Yup because I did this makeup test after I got my new suit at 3 o clock yesterday. After I already did my morning makeup. Lol ,2
"Hey Mr. Feige! First of all I want to congratulate and thank you, and the whole team at Marvel Studios for making such an epic journey and ending it perfectly with Avengers: Endgame. My question to you is about the post-credits scene of Avengers: Age of Ultron. The scene shows Thanos putting on the Infinity Gauntlet and saying  Fine, I ll do it myself . When and where is Thanos in that scene?",1
SPACE AVENGERS!!!!!,1
This cruel injustice of this is heartbreaking and infuriating. You have so much to live for and there are people that don t want to live another day or the cruel and corrupt people that live healthy into old age. I wish people could volunteer to trade places with young people like you.  IDK a gofundme for a dream trip or experience? ,1
Oh shit guys it happened.,1
Or half the letters:  Avenge ,1
"Poor Spidey, went from fighting a normal working class guy in a scrappy flying suit, to taking on the biggest badass in the universe.",3
Can I have a job at Marvel Studios?,1
"Isn't choosing unknowns a good thing if they audition well? They have something to prove, they're fresh blood and they want to forge a career",1
"Hmm, maybe it's Simone Missick (Misty Knight from Luke Cage)   Maybe you should try cosplaying her, robot arms are cool!",3
Has marvel offered you a job yet?,1
Maybe it's the new Sharknado,3
"Make a shameless repost, changing it up to point out it was you who made the request while thanking Taika Waititi. You don't even have to do it now. You could wait a few days or weeks.",3
Always happy to help lol,2
The most fucked up part is that now his little girl is suck with Gwyneth Paltrow as a mom.,1
" Bobby, if you weren t my son, I d hug you right now ",2
Wrong subreddit bruddah,3
"When you look at a movie from a critic standpoint kinda. IW had better pacing and felt a lot smoother. Obviously both movies were great and endgame had a far larger cultural impact, but without that whole hype factor IW was simply a more well designed movie if that makes sense. Still. There's no reason to really compare them like that.",2
So many things wrong with this comment,3
Whatever it takes!!! Take me!,1
Grandpa Simpson,1
"Damn...yup, that checks out.",2
"That was insane, thank you for bringing this into my life.  The part where cap throws his shield is one of the most satisfying things I ve ever seen btw.",1

TIME TRAVEL! /hulkgrin,2
Hi Kevin you re my role model. My question is: Who do you think will claim the Iron Throne for good on Sunday?,1
Pee is stored in the titties,3
"Nothing to do with intellect or wit or anything. But if you know jack shit about a subject, why comment on it? You're not helping, you're not adding. You're just being a narcissist who feels the world is waiting on your uninformed, childish, false statements before it goes on. Take a look in the mirror and try to not be so egocentric.",0
"Spidey is EXTREMELY durable, but even with that, his speed, intelligence and his motormouth has given him the edge in their confrontations in the comics.  With those two, anything can happen, and most likely there wouldn t even be a winner, it would probably end in a draw with Hulk respecting  bug mans  strength. But since we have Prof. Hulk now that probably won t ever happen.",2
HOLY INFINITY FUCK,1
How insane is Stark going to go if he finds out Pepper got snapped?  ,1
Iirc Angela Basset (who plays Ramona) actually said that she and Shuri survived so I'm really intrigued too about Shuri appearing there!,1
Bruh it's thicc,1
"Zooey Deschanel! Nice,",1
"IMHO, this is the *only chance* they have at getting close to GWTW.",3
Kevin Feige I am So happy you are here with us on Reddit!!! -- Obviously I'm a huge huge fan!! Question: Are there any female superhero's you would like to make into a movie (or series) that (like Ironman) aren't the most popular in the comic world ??,1
No and im intrigued,1
You sure sound like a happy fulfilled dude who doesn't project his stuff all over the place.,2
"Hey mr. Feige, It s cool to see you doing this but I was really curious... Did you all see the meme going around about Ant Man killing Thanos by shrinking, going up his anus, then growing to the size of a 4 story building? What did you think? Was an alternate ending ever considered?",2
We get very apprehensive when people start saying certain phrases that we've gotten used to hearing from a certain subgroup of people.,1
What is going on in this movie!,1
"you're a wonderful human being, Sarah.",3
"Hi Kevin, i know you would rather talk about released movies but pleeeeaaase, do you know something about future of Daredevil in MCU, he is my fav character, thanks :)",1
"Considering there s a good chance marvel was going to make him kinda like Tony Stark 2 in the sense he s the center of the mcu, I can see rdj getting involved. He had a very good relationship with Tom didn t he?",3
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business!",3
"Why did it say  8 years later  in 'Spider-man: Homecoming', when the time jump was only 4 years?",1
 METOO thwarted again good job. ,1
but what if he spoils it?,0
"In the MCU Hulk's body hasn't been known to grow bigger once he's already transformed. In the comics, maybe, but that doesn't happen in the movies. And in Ragnarok, he's been shown to know a lot more than people think. He battled with armor and weapons then, and knew about the technological advancements in his home in Sakaar.",1
"finally, we did it......",1
HOLE. E. SH *T!!! That was absolutely amazing. This should be used for the ad for the Ultimate MCU BluRay box set that they'll no doubt be putting out around Christmas. Do you have a link for this on YouTube?,1
They did say he was gonna stay R,3
"12 year old humor, no no sub poster. I've seen all I need to see here, let's wrap it up folks.",1
Lol anything featuring a woman being equal to a man is feminism,2
Lol AoS gets a lot of shit so it's hard to tell sometimes.,1
"Sorry, what intentionally altered shots? ",1
"It originally means stalker fan, but now it's just kinda used in the same way as fan, usually implied as like a hardcore fan lol.",2
"I wonder what this means for those planned animated shows, doubt they re happening at this point.",2
Is that the fucking MOHAWK I see?,1
Externals sounds great,2
"People from all over the world exchange snacks from their home countries :). But they're pretty strict about being able to submit, which I totally get!",1

"You don't have to commit crime if you're poor. Maybe in debt but even if you don't have a cent to your name you can work through it. Unless you have a violent drug addiction or past criminal records. Those are the real problems, not being poor.",2
He doesn't know or care about any of that. The Russo's have stated that none of that had any effect on Thanos deciding to collect the stones. Thanos could beat them all easily.,3
"Ok fair I removed my downvotes, but you cant say these movies aren't unique. Yeah they have similar elements to each other and other films in general, but pretty much all movies are like that. It especially noticeable with marvel movies just because of how popular they are. And some of them are very generic stories (black panther, ant man) but a lot of them are pretty unique in their own way.  Speaking out for something you like isn't circle jerking. What a fucking immature word",1
Now your thinking with portals! And where are my god damn flammable lemons?!,1
"Yep. A Superman knockoff with bland, uninspired acting. I want a gritty female superhero. ",2
"Hi Mr. Feige! I was wondering if there was one thing you could go back and redo in any of the movies in the MCU, what would it be?",1
Power and prayers to you,2
This sub is extremely annoying and narrow minded at times but it always seems to be in favour of representation and the users who aren t get downvoted. If you want somebody bad go over to the Star Wars fandom or something.  Anyways your clearly unable to converse properly with people so no point talking here,1
I wish she kept the blue mane.,1
You re so cool.  (Not sarcasm!) Please post when it s finished :) ,3
"They won t. I enjoy the Marvel flicks, but for the most part they aren t made with a particular visual style. They re slaves to the effects, and that gives everything a sameyness to it all.  The Russo s will make other movies that probably have more distinctive visual style, but these aren t it.",2
Unless it's a Republican Then hang em in the street right reddit?,3
The fact you feel the need to call everyone  nerds  for getting excited over something is very sad,3

I live in a 7/11 bathroom in Burbank.,3
Damn... She pulls that off Hela good,1

Why did you decide to make a Captain Marvel movie before a Nova movie? Nova would make more sense considering his origin story could have started out with Thanos destroying his home planet and it could have been him vs. a member of the black order.,1

 Who the hell are you guys Oh yes. Yes.,1
"Sony would net more by keeping him in MCU than pulling and creating their own movies at this point. So, while yes, the mouse can be greedy, this wasn t exactly a bad deal for Sony to make for their cash cow. Who wants to see another spider man reboot?",2
THAT YOUNG COULSON THOUGH!!,3
"There s a line in Avengers Assemble where Nick Fury says  Last year, Earth had a visit from another planet that had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously outgunned. Based on the Captain Marvel movie, why did he not realise that from those events?",1

Hi Kevin! Will you ever release a Lord of the Rings scale behind the scenes feature of the infinity War / Endgame production process? I know I would love that! Thanks!,1
Who threw that spear at Cap? SO HYPED,1
"Films don't all have to follow the exact same narrative structure.      The fact that there is conflict in the movie means there must be an antagonist. That's not debatable. We can argue about *who* or *what* the antagonist is, or whether it's the same as the  villain  (the two aren't synonyms,   frequently things are  deliberately (url) switched  around (url)), but there still has to be *some* antagonist.",1
Yeah lol probably not. They re not saying  this is the last movie and we re only doing trilogies  but duh. ,0
This is extremely impressive! Good job,1
"I mean, we had two movies (Thor, The Dark World) where there was more emotion and a darker/serious tone.",0

"Hi Kevin! Despite multiple characters and objects jumping from one franchise to another, I think that what really made people love the MCU as a whole were (and still are) the character arcs, when and why did you and the rest of Marvel start planning their arcs including both their main franchises and the group movies? What motivated that change? Thank you!",1

"Soooooo basically there were a bunch of cool costume concepts that weren t used. Thor, Cap, Blackmon Widow... I wish we could see all of these in  What If .",1
"It's crazy to me that Dr. Strange, a movie all about time....is too short. There so many things that could have been included in that movie to make it stand out more.",1
"Plus, it's not like it has to be cheesy or boring at all. I can imagine people throwing food at her while she's on stage because they're anti-mutant and stuff. It could become a good story.",2
Any chance we are going to see Riri? I think her being Carol s grand niece would be cool.,1
That's my line of thinking as well.,2
They used the quantum realm to go back in time and change the trailer!,3
Thank you. Do the TV show add a significant amount to the story or are they more like fillers?,1

Oh my goddess!! That was great! Very excited about this movie. Seems she is going in her binary form at the end of the trailer! YES!!! Did you all know that Kevin Feige said she is the most powerful hero the MCU has ever seen?

"Feige needs to start making 1-2 movies per year.  There is far less time devoted to pre/post production and everything is sort of rushed to coincide with a near MCU film s start of filming/release. This is why to ME, these movies are just good enough and haven t really made me super impressed. I don t think I ve ever rated an MCU film above a 7.5/10.",2
"That s the problem with mixing Thor, Hulk, Vision, Dr Strange and Captain Marvel with the other Avengers lol. Thor could deal with every movie on his own basically.",2

"Rami Malek isn t necessarily a bad actor, but he has a tendency to overact and his characters more often than not feel more like cartoon caricatures than real people. It s probably an unpopular opinion, but I don t think he deserved the Oscar for *Bohemian Rhapsody* by a long shot. Handled right, that hamminess could translate well with Spector s instability and help the character feel genuinely unhinged. But he s far from my top pick for the part.",2

"Did anyone else see this coming since the entire gotg cast, almost every MCU crew member and Mark freaking Hamill supported him? I m betting they just waited for the situation to calm down to rehire him after immediately realising their mistake ",1
Post something idiotic and get called an idiot. Shocking...,0
"I think they made a calculated decision in FFH. Yes, they made spidey a larger part of the MCU, but also tied him much closer to it as well. This makes it difficult for Sony to not negotiate with Marvel as it is now difficult to separate on both sides.",3
> Sony should just let Disney buyout the character for a few billion. The character already belongs to Disney. What Sony have is a license to produce movies using the Spider-Man extended universe.,0
He got nominated for a fucking oscar for intentionally playing a character in black face. He had a legit chance at beat supporting actor is heath ledger didn't die.,1
Word. Disney overestimated the expected level of uproar over his pedophile tweets.,0
"endgame relies heavily on the attachment we already feel to all the characters.   for anyone who walks into it without that attachment, endgame is just  another meh superhero movie, whats all the fuss about. why is everyone reacting that way to this random dude? its probably a good thing that these people dont see it until they have that attachment, and can appreciate the movie properly",1

"Flower the racist characterization of a slave, centaur from Fantasia, gallops away.",3
"Yeah, that scene is all over the place. We have Hawkeye just feeling sad. Then Black Panther reads it wrong and is the one who really start the kneeling homage. We have Valkyrie taking way longer than Nebula to kneel because every character needed their moment. We have War Machine not kneeling. We have the Manthis gag.  I like the scene, especially with the Strange implication cited here before, but I believe that to work it should have been filmed in a different way.",1
"Didn't know anything about him so just had a quick google, seems there are rumours Marvel are trying to poach Henry Cavill from DC to play him, that would be quite amusing, lol",1

They would ve gotten GOT 2.0 darkness complaints if they didn t fix it.",1

Marvel: everyone's gonna be talking about the trailer. Everyone: yo where's the guy drinking his own pee?,1
"Early on I think it got to him. He wanted to do more artistic movies. Marvel wasn't doing that. They were doing the typical hero stuff.  After Infinity War, I think he started to second guess his role in the future of these movies.  Now I can see him teaming up with the Russo brothers to do a 4th Captain America movie. And he will be Old Man Steve Rogers, new director of Shield",0

"Nah, they completely skipped over his arc in Endgame after all the set up in Infinity War.",1
Couldn't 'enhanced' just be a catch-all term for people who were given powers? As in Cap and Hulk would be covered by it too. General Ross uses the term to refer to the Avengers in Civil War.  It just seems is that mutants with super powers would be a thing and no one in the MCU has had to seriously deal with it.,1

"Given he remembered every part of the bargaining sequence, I want to say he's trained for millenia while only a few seconds have passed on Earth. Plus the astral plane apparently can exist outside of time also, so he could logically spend eons in stasis over the course of a single night's rest. Add that to his incredible intellect and he could easily be the most powerful sorceror on midgard.",3
They pull the arrow truck from Civil War again with Scott pulling off the gauntlet...,2
Alan Horn done jumped the  gun Gunn. FTFY,1
From what I ve seen so far it s going to be much smaller and more grounded than any of those. Just from the little clip we saw from comic con and the fighting scenes I think it will be a spy thriller on marvel steroids. I m super excited for it. And I need taskmaster.,1

I can see fairly well!,3
"I ve never seen any of these movies but this montage was pretty cool! Thanks OP, for your work on this comp!",1
One of the largest reasons as to why he was fired is because of the talks surrounding fox and Disney. Disney didn t want any issues so as soon as that popped up they were like fuck it fire him make it go away. ,1
Thought tag doesn t have a last name ,1
But at least he got the van!!!,1
How big is Dave Bautista?,2
That is one sexy Brother Voodoo And hell yeah to Shuma-Gorath. Given the Lovecraft-inspired title he just has to be in the movie.,3

"True, but there s a considerable gap between the violence of the MCU and the blasters of Star Wars, and Kingpin turning a dudes head to jam with the door of a car.  Here s a philosophical question- would people accept the current DD team (cast, crew) but with toned down violence? Could it even work?",1
"OK, so I'm really getting an indie film vibe from the cinematography especially. This doesn't look like any Marvel film/trailer has in the past, the framing, Depth of Field, Colour and Tone is really different to what the other ones look like",1

I still don't trust them because what if they pull this again after Spider-Man 3 untitled Home film.,1
The truth is...he was fired from the start,3

"So the writers and directors of Endgame have disagreed with Steve's time travelling. The Russo Brothers say that Steve went to a different timeline to marry Peggy, but McFeely and Markus have said that Steve was always married to Peggy in this timeline, but we just didn't know it. Do you have any insight into this?",1
Probably only happens later in the movie,1
Holy shit it looks epic. Thoughts: Spider sense is officially a thing! Stark has an arc reactor under his hoodie! What is the giant machine Thor is pulling together?! ,1
"Spiderman held on longer than most, and he's not nearly the most powerful avenger",2
"I think more than that is how much he truly did not like Tony, but by the end he respected him",1
It seems to me like she made inroads toward joining. Vol 2 is set four years prior to Infinity War so stuff definitely happened between them because in IW Mantis calls Nebula to coordinate against Thanos.,1
"Scott Caan at 5 5 would be a good little Wolverine. Familiar but not a major star, rugged handsome look.",3
"Well that's very incorrect. It's exactly the people that understand what money means that would try adjusting for inflation, and it's exactly the people that just want their favorite new movie's name to be beside a high number without understanding anything about that number and don't want to think past that and consider a more complicated reality that don't adjust (or don't even understand inflation).",1

Hi Kevin! Could you give us something of the history of WandaVision?,1
I kind of feel like that is what they are shooting for with Disney+ I have enjoyed the Marvel movies as well but I am not sure how I feel about them past Endgame.  I would rather they not tire out the genre so damn quick.  Too many knockoffs and spoofs too even if they are good like Defendor or Super.,1
What s your favorite brand and flavor of ice cream?,1
Pom H ,1
Britney was a major figure during my formative years. All of this brings back those terrible memories of her but i can't even begin to describe how great it makes me feel that she was able to come out of this all for the better. The spotlight that shone on her makes the type of recovery she needed nearly impossible but she did it and should be praised for it if only for showing her kids the type of strength they'll need as life progresses.,3
Epic isn't it? Has to force the others signatures around it!,3

What is tour favourite movie of the MCU?  And hero?,1
Didn't even notice that 3 of the stones were given to save someone.,2
Can t believe that this is the last season,1
I use to go to school with a girl that was on American Idol and then ironically Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. ,1
That s way too much effort to go through just to laugh at people from the sidelines.,3
"If she did I hope it was one Gemma Simmons famous sammiches with Prosciuito, Mozzarella, Basil and Pesto Aioli...",1
Shuri is confirmed decimated. So will we see Mbaku as the king of Wakanda?,1
"Was there ever a plan on the table to have Ant-Man defeat Thanos by flying up his butt and turning into Giant-Man?  If so, why not go with the bold ending?",1
THIS BOOM YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.,1
"Absolutely gorgeous! I usually don t care much/at all for fan content, but this might as well be the trailer for the MCU.",1
"That s cool, but do you remember the line from AoU that specifies the amount of time the Avengers have been reunited and searching for the scepter?",1
" You ordered a miracle, Your Majesty? ",1
You fucked up the title. That's not how it works ,1
We all do,1
"Species age differently, his species could age faster than Thor s",1
"I agree wholeheartedly. Jackman is such a definitive actor for the character that I really would prefer if they left Logan for a while. None of the fancastings work nearly as well as Hugh did, IMO. If the MCU needs to have a Wolverine, I think it should be Laura Kinney. She s a great character in her own right and could carry the mantle without overshadowing her teammates. Marvel could even bring back Dafne Keen for the role once she s a teenager.",1
"I was hoping this would happen. They placaded the people who stirred up his past (which wasn't even that bad) , and now that some time has passed they can reinstate him and the general public won't even know what happened",1
"Hail to the King, Baby",3
"A joke coming from a woman who was repeatedly warned about her behavior on social media. Turns out if you keep making inappropriate comments after being warned you might have some karma coming your way. And I'm sure you've seen that those jokes fit well in line with the kind of dark humor movies he was working on at the time. It doesnt matter that were having this conversation. I dont care about roseanne, but you're so wrapped up in your politics nothing I say on this matter would change your mind. ",2
That indent vs bump was a GameBoy vs Gameboy Color cartridge thing.,1
"Perhaps in one of Strange's alternate futures, the gauntlet is cut off but somehow Thanos still wins. Funny to think about, I agree.",1

His most definitive characterization isn t that but he definitely would be downgraded if they went PG-13 with him.,2

I don't think any of that stuff in his personal life effects his reputation as a director. I'm terms of being able to put together a successful movie he has the reputation from the Guardians movies which were both critically and commercially well received. He is well respected by everyone he has worked with recently. I'm not sure what metric you're using to consider his quality as director besides saying his two most successful movie were lacklustre in your opinion.,1
Just waiting for the stark tower to be named the baxter building to keep this ball rolling.,0
Cause you are built like an absolute unit. I can see why.,1
Am I ?,1
Also fellow directors that got offered to film it all declined the movie out of respect for Gunn.,3
I got confused by his hands. But the suit is red and black as well,1
"Purple, so from Nova corps?",1
Ok Jonny Greenwood ,1
Don't you mean a damp squid?,3
Fucking dope,1
Ditto. They really nailed this trailer. ,1
Tony has multiple suits. Cap can t use the shield to protect all sides of his body. Plus Tony could rain explosives down on Cap for an extended period of time.,1
In the comics she could. I think that she always was capable of doing it as she is consistently ready to die for others. She suggested a sacrifice in AoU and in WS she said how she was covering the engineer Bucky shot and that she sacrificed herself for the stone. I think she was always worthy but it was too subtle to warrant a cap like scene so she decided she wouldn t try.,2
"In a MANCAVE, to be exact!!",3
Why is there no movie in March 2020?,1
"All the character chemistry is built during the stand alone movies in my opinion. But it s up to you, some is better than none! ",1
Legendary outlaw?,1
It s clearly bought lol,1
Gonna be honest I just watched it with New Avengers overlaid and it sounded sick. idk what you have against Elfman but his theme is awesome and I wish it came back,2
Either way I don t listen to what Directors or writers say about their work. Especially writers that add info far after the fact. Like JK Rowling. I feel a person s work should speak for itself.,0
She was fighting Wanda. Okoye and Black widow show up to aid her.,1
Hey Kevin! Congrats on such a huge success  What was the most difficult film to work on and why?? I assume endgame but is there another for a different reason?,1
Stan Lee Tribute https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvIQweCHtGY feature=youtu.be,1
It s been said but... yah... he really do,3
"Hey Kevin, thanks for doing this! For my question. Are you able to talk a little about what a typical day in the life of Kevin Feige is like?  Not sure how much detail you can give, but would be interesting nonetheless!",3
Except that a lot of his character development was him letting go of the past and embracing the present. So while the end of his story is heartwarming it doesn't make a lot of sense if you look at how he was being portrayed.,1
You will be pleased to know that I have been out of treatment for about 7 months now.,1
"I'm like 100 37  sure this is mocking him... why tho? He's awesome. Yeah he doesn't have some cool animated superpowers, but he can shoot arrows fucking a perfectly like no other. I started bow shooting because of him, and damn is it fun. He's cool. Stop it. Justice for Hawkeye!",1
Huh. I always thought it was the other way around.,1
Highlander did it first.,1
"I honestly thought this was a joke post until I saw the other post on r/television What. The. Fuck. Daredevil just had one of the best seasons of superhero/crime drama's I have ever seen. I get the contract issues and Disney with their new service, but this is all kinds of fucked up. Daredevil imo is officially the first casualty of the looming war between streaming services in the future. This really bummed me out.",1
> Star Wars has more impact than any single comic book easily.  I don't believe this is correct.  I'd put the most influential comic book as Action Comics  1 (First appearance of Superman/the birth of superheroes) and I think it's had more cultural impact in the long-run than Star Wars has.   ,2
"I completely agree but I also feel like they set up Carol to crush him. The directors of Captain Marvel were fucking awful and produced a bad movie with a character I didn t like. But the Russos, I m sure they will then that into something I love and not the disaster that she was in her solo movie.",0

JoJo Rabbit was so good.,1
Great can everybody shut up and stop complaining now,1
She's producing it because no one else wants to.  She's got no powers or special gifts.  She's a female Jason Bourne just set in the MCU.  Its gonna fail.,0
"My wishful thinking is that She-Hulk takes place between the 5-year-gap, and so not only adds more detail to what happened between that time but also allows us to watch some of Banner's transformation into Professor Hulk. I'd enjoy seeing Jennifer Walters being the one to make Banner realize that he doesn't have to  treat the Hulk as a disease,  but that he must instead find balance.",3
"Oh, we're using our made up names...  Good to know if Cap   Iron Man retire or..... those two will still be going strong.",1
Endgame is the perfect title.,1
Isn t she in legion??,3
It s gonna be like a punch in the gut from the infinity gauntlet :( ,1
Holy hell this is amazing,1
"I want spend an entire day watching the Avengers, the hype is SO REAL.",1
She's still fit af with any hair,1
Hulk throws Ant-Man who grows into Giant-Man  mid-flight. ,1
"> like Nuke on Jess Jones Funny you mention that, because in the comics, John Walker became a super-soldier because of an experiment done on him by Karl Malus. (For  obvious reasons (https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Karl Malus) this is unlikely to be the same in the MCU.)",1
He is mid way through high school though timeline wise. Still a great pick and had both the charisma and agility needed. How behind the scenes stuff where he does good own stunts is awesome,2
"Hey Kevin, first off just want to thank you for doing what no one has ever done before by creating the MCU. My question is was there ever any consideration to bring back Coulson for Endgame?",1
it's Shang-fucking-Chi. he'll just punch it,2
This is the type of thing I would expect to see at comic con or D23! It s so hype and professional looking,1
Yes! Actual scene with Thanos in his helmet and armor! I was afraid we were only going to see Malibu Beach House Thanos in this film. ,1
Marvel should hire you to make transitions for their movies. Imagine if transitions like these ended up in the final battle in Endgame...,1

Wasn't it just that one guy that he tripped and threw off the walkway?,3
Can you confirm whether the MCU takes place on Earth-616 or Earth-19999?,1
"Oh my god, Cap stopped his punch",2
Maybe we ll get a captain America cameo of him in a block of ice!,1
 I'm back  literally summed it up perfectly,1
"Funny  I was just watching this last night and thought the same thing. This scene wasn't about the characters, it was about the different companies. Marvel is down for it. Sony is not. So in a way this was a foreshadowing what the studio knew was going to happen.",1
Because of the tax,1
My dude. Pacific Rim was supposed to be that for Mountains of Madness. So. I guess I m not gonna get my hopes up for anything I want. Lol,1
Even he probably had to say that he liked Black Panther or else.,0
That s... not how credits work.,0
Dude you kind of look like Joshua Jackson and now I m wondering what it would have been if he had been cast as Mysterio. He was awesome in Fringe,1
BoP ?,1

"Theoretically, in an alternate timeline, isn t Iron Man still alive? Or did the timelines separate after he snapped?",2
It's gonna be hard to get Rightclops without Cap....,1
holy fuck this is cringe af,2
Yeah. But the question was who he is  nor the direction the show will go,1
"In the final clip with Carol, Nat has blonde hair, but in the rest of the trailer she has her old red hair. Or was that not Nat?",1

But, there also could have been more, and if you ask John Semper, Jr., the showrunner, they had a lot more planned, but Arad was trying to assert his own power on the show so he could sell more toys. So, Margaret Loesch, the head of Fox Kids, in a bigger power move, cancelled the show.",1

Brilliant. Top class.  How much time did you spend making it?,0
I'm not saying that's not what it's supposed to be. It definitely is supposed to be her roots. I'm saying that they made a mistake because it's way to long for that blonde to still be there from Infinity War. I get that it's a way to denote how long it's been but when they have already told us it was unnecessary.,0
"Season 1 was that way a bit, but without revealing spoilers, there were some of the  villains of the week  that eventually became proper villains of the show (and really good ones). But a majority of the show is focused on the main plot. Occasional smaller plots here and there, but they usually have an impact on the main story.",1
"As a huge Star Wars fan, in some ways I wished he just never made them.  I mean, that's blasphemy for /r/PrequelMemes, I realize that.  If you ever watch the documentaries you can see that he was setting these up as an advertisement for what ILM could do.  It was pretty clear he was trying to move the technology forward so it would be marketable to other film productions.  So there are some positives to take away from it.",2

"I'm hoping so, so he can have a heroic death a la *Siege*. It'd complete Loki's redemption arc nicely (especially considering this is probably one of Tom Hiddleston's Loki's last appearances.) And if Thor did give Loki the weapon to use then clearly that failed horribly since Thanos does have the tesseract/space stone invading earth, and there's no sight of Loki in the scenes from the leaked Comic Con footage of everyone on Earth (unless Loki's pulled some miraculous getaway elsewhere.)",1
Love the way rocket walks along with everyone in the avengers headquarters,1
From the article I read it seemed like Disney wanted more money and Sony said no after wanting to keep the terms the same.  This whole thing was a power play by Disney and Sony called their bluff.

well wadya know - a movie I'd like to see!,1

Well commercial airliners would be fine if one of two pilots are there. they mos def train for one pilot being incapacitated due to heart attacks or other ailments. I have to think that commercial ships would be the same way as well. too much money on them to rely on one single point of failure. ,1

I also like how Bruce and Rhodes aren't even facing the right direction and how Rhodes is almost entirely blocking the camera's view of Peter.",1
Genuine question just because I don't know the answer... doesn't the snap not  kill  people but just make them  not exist ? x200B Does the Phoenix Force only resurrect dead people... meaning it couldn't resurrect someone that isn't actually dead? x200B No idea how the stuff works.,1

After endgame came out even, I don't hate Brie Larson, I just didn't like her performance or the weiting in her movie.",2

I skipped all trailers and tv spots for The force awakens. It was hard. If i went to movies and the TFA trailer played b4 the movie I was seeing i either left he theater or put my fingers in my ears and hummed. I still heard certain lines like Han daying  chewie were home  talking about the falcon but i didn't see or hear 99  of it. Which made tfa a blast in theaters for me. Having cut cable made avoiding any tv spots relatively easy though. Reddit was more difficult to navigate.,1

"This is the best possible news for the cosmic side of the MCU. Continuity in how to handle the space stuff.  Also while I still understand the original decision that was made by Disney, it also helps to show that you dont have to live or die by your first judgment call, and there is always room to talk and expand on previous decisions made.  Also its great DC gets to still keep him on for SS2. He should do a great job pushing that franchise in a better place.",1

This happened to one of my friends in work. She was getting repeated mouth ulcers that weren't healing.

"I can suggest quite a few comics that might change your mind.  Venom is more like what if a slightly psycho/disturbed person gained spidermans powers. They want to do good, be the hero, but they cant help but go about it a little overboard. Add to that a mutual hate from both the symbiote and host and you have my favorite comic book villain. His popularity turned him into an anti-hero, but there are great stories outside of the Lethal Protector line (which launched that whole thing).",1

I feel like they might be pulling a bait and switch again. Before it was  yep it's totally Hulk in Wakanda  and now it's  yep it's totally normal Bruce in this lab .  I think Professor Hulk is essentially going to take much of Ruffalo's actual screen time. ,3

Pretty sure Marvel Studios does not handle this part of the brand. (I previously worked at Insomniac),2
That s for now. Who knows what the future holds. Venom 2 bombs and Sony just sell it back to Marvel outright. They extend after spider man 3. Sony Pictures gets bought by amazon or Apple and the rights automatically revert back to Marvel. A lot can happen in 3-5 years.,3

And the cult of screeching reactionaries whining about how the mean woman no smile and how Black Panther is racist are equally childish.

Disney probably realized the amount of money they'll make with Gunn and supporting fans will trump whatever loss they would've gotten from the haters. No need to placate the minority who might not even spend the money to warch G3 even if they change director after all this outrage. ,1

"Plenty of actors have said you only have to work a few days when voicing characters in cinema. This isn't Toy Story, he's not in and out the studio for 3 years, he's not got monumental monologues, or pages of dialogue. He comes in near the end of the process and records all his lines. It will probably be about 2 or 3 days work and then another day much later as they finalise and do reshoots.",3

"Compared to Omega level mutant X-men, reality breaking magicians, a gamma ray burst contained inside muscles, a guy with a suit of armour that's at least 200 years away technology wise, a Norse god, and cosmic entities, I'd say he's on the lower end. Though he's definitely one of the strongest street level heroes. ",3
"Because if the mutants are going to exist in the MCU we need one. The fact that we've never seen one or heard mention of one during this many stories means we'll need to write them in somehow. Unless Marvel wants to start a different universe with a different timeline for their X-men stories, which I personally don't think is a great idea.",1

Lol I'm really not... I'm just saying I wonder how it will fit in... Yes they are all for money...but the previous 22 films all fit into a larger story line and I'm just saying I hope this isn't just an afterthought and somehow fits into whatever they have planned next...,3

Only took a wackass CGI Hulk lol what a clown world,1
I've been waiting for his tweet or what have you about the news today. Weird that he hasn't posted anything yet. Glad he was outspoken though,1
"That doesn't mean the majority didn't greet the announcement with derision and disbelief. Long time comic book fans were different, of course. But there were lots of articles, posts etc. about how stupid and awful it was going to be and how it would flop and could be the end of the Marvel juggernaut. I'm so glad they were wrong, but that opinion was everywhere.",1

I always loved how he says that line. The perfect combination of horrified and furious,3

"ENDGAME SPOILERS AHEAD SERIOUSLY x200B If every time someone goes back in time in Endgame they generate a new time-line, and if captain america went back and spent all of his time with peggy, as we see by the end of the movie, how did he not generate another timeline instead of just sticking around in the 'prime' MCU timeline with all of our heroes and stuff?",1
"Breaks my heart to see him go, I knew it wouldnt be long once his wife passed. Truly a huge loss of creativity to the world. Hurts me, bad. He touched so many people, his stories and characters helped so many kids and adults through tough times. Real years here, guys. RIP.",1
"No need to apologize. I expected this when I wrote up the comment, because it seems like the majority of users here just can't accept any criticism of *Endgame*. It's by no means a completely terrible movie, but it has its issues, a glaring one being the treatment of a few characters, which I just can't ignore. I'm hoping Kevin can bring me some closure with a reply, but I doubt he'll see my comment since it's so downvoted. C'est la vie.",3
Literally have no words as to how great this is.,1
"The first episodes i thought were already good. She got annoying when she tried to do the crime fighting and getting involved with literally everything. I want to see a show about Daredevil, not her getting into trouble every time she wants to pretend to be a crime fighter. She got WAY too much screen time. They could have made her character mean something, but no. All her character did was meddle in anything she could find and people were killed simply because of her... for no reason whatsoever.",1

that is SO GOOD,1
"I agree with Doom being a Loki-esque character, an antagonist that is carried throughout the phases acting as both a antagonist and maybe anti-hero when it suits his purposes.

100  agree. Very glad that this didn't make the final cut. The way the scene ended in the finished version made the death more impactful and real. Drawing it out like this puts the focus on to other characters instead of letting the scene be about Tony and the ultimate sacrifice he made.,1
I could literally cry. I've spent far too much time worrying about this shit.,1

"Wonderful work by everyone involved in Thanos s creation on screen. That expression on his face just barely betrays little cracks in his confidence, like  What exactly did I step into here? ",2
"Bro I'm glad they removed this because my ass would be crying even harder. Still great seeing all the heavy hitters except hulk kneel, which I guess he would if the scene wasnt deleted and visual effects team slapped him on.",0
He did though. He rockbottomed Jason Statham's ass,2

"I'm probably going to articulate this terribly and get downvoted to oblivion, so here it goes... Here's what I think Larson was saying: if a movie is trying to portray the experiences of young, black women, shouldn't we be listening to them first and foremost, because they'll be the ones who actually know if the portrayal and the message rings true or not more than anyone? With film critics being overwhelmingly white and male, those voices get drowned out.",2
"It depends on what you're looking for.  Avenger movies will win in terms of epic battles, seeing all the heroes together will always be awesome.  Solo movies win in terms of story, they are more personal and with the smaller cast they can be polished a bit more.",1
It s because Dave s followers are wrestling fans ,1
I watched Actors on Actors recently and Evans didnt give a hard no to coming back at some point. He said it would have to be worth it and not just some cash grab. Boseman might change his tune after the box office results for 21 Bridges. I dont have a crystal ball but something tells it wont make a lot of money.,1

Silver surfer is the one that tells strange about thanos but Fox is big ass bitch.,1
"Why was the decision made to turn the Hulk and Thor, the two most powerful characters in the Avengers, into comic relief for arguably the most important movie in the MCU?",1
His face was molded to become the most hated guy in the movies. Just as much as Hugo Weaving.,1
He forgot,1
Impossible. His reflexes are simply too fast.,1
Guess it was spotty before then but it really started with  X-Men (https://amp.thisisinsider.com/stan-lee-marvel-cameos-2017-3),2
"Does anyone think it would be cool if the last we saw of Tony is him drifting off into space?  Then, in like Phase 6 or something, he returns in a huge twist as the MCU version of Kang or something. He was driven insane and blames the Avengers for  abandoning  him. Maybe?",0
"Iron Man could. If they could stop him getting a suit, he would be done in seconds.",2
I guess not,0
"Kudos to every level headed person who said that the 50/50 was an initial offer and that proper negotiation would bring it down to 66/33 or 25/75. In a sea of 99  hysteria and fanboyism on both sides, there were absolutely sane and intelligent voices who knew exactly what was going on and accurately predicted the outcome that would happen if both parties wanted to continue working together. (Barring that it was an excuse for a breakup)",1
Ok now this is epic. I need some more 80 s music in my movies.,2

"In guardians of the Galaxy volume 1, he specifically said that Gamora is his favorite daughter , and was blaming Ronan for her capture. He didn t even believe Ronan saying that Gamora planned to betrayed them all. So I think you re right. Gamora might be a goner. ",2
Thor and The Mighty Thor looking fire. Hopefully Thor gets that look.,1
"Look at him folks! He's such a big guy. And green! We love our smart Hulk, don't we folks?",3
"Half of humanity as a whole, if you snapped groups instead of as a whole then it d be unbalanced, and you know how Thanos is about balance",3
I feel like we can all agree that  Pom Klementieff  needs to chill out. He's not Hancock and isn't declaring independence from great Britain. ,1

"Ok, that s fine. I get it was part of an interview and they probably just threw an answer to feed fans.",1
"Hawk-eye never came back. Hawk-eye is dead. Ronin however, Ronin has a mission of revenge. I hope Thor has room on his Revenger's team.",1
"I m with you. I like the humor in many of the Marvel films but I also like other things, other emotions. Ragnarok is only humor with nothing else. And hey it is fun, and it looks cool, but it doesn t hold up for me against some of the more balanced films.",1
Maybe in this version he needs to activate the stone for it to work.. It seems the 2 stones in his gauntlet has no light or is not glowing.. Perhaps it glows when his using its power.. Dunno haha I've no idea why cap stopped him there. ,1
Gambit was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine.,1
Are you always like this or is it just a bad day,2
Looking great!,2
Love love love this too much! ,1
Thor or Natasha probably. I feel like Star-Lord is a good candidate for a single movie arc (GotG) but overall feels like he hasn t changed much considering Guardians 2 and the Avengers movies.,1

"Yeah,... no he s just getting started! He has at least another 10 years in him. ",1
Hawkeye is one of the roles that's so underwritten that I feel like any actor could have played the part. It's disappointing seeing how they waste Jeremy Renner's talent.,1

I never expected you to.. or anyone else at that.,1
Please continue these. amazing.,1
Hi Kevin-  Thanks for the wonderful stories that I can enjoy with my kids. It s given us some really special memories of playing avengers together!  I used to be a massive Star Wars fan - which seems to have gone astray.  if you were give the Star Wars people some advice to capture some of the Marvel Magic - What would you suggest to them ?,1

"What is your favorite incorrect fan theory? I personally loved the theory that Spiderman: Far From Home was fake and just made up to throw fans off about the true ending of Endgame.  Thanks so much for dong this and a second bigger thanks for releasing the films with such great captioning, so many films especially in theaters are poorly captioned but I have gotten to enjoy the MCU just like everyone else!",1
I don't care. A person can type the same comment as yours and they owe you ZERO explanation for it. Move on.,1
That last shot just confirmed that this takes place in the Leftovers universe,1
Just imagine Thor. He is 1500 years old. The past 10 years of Marvel events have basically been like a month for him.,3
SPIDEY SWINGIN THROUGH THE DEBRIS LOOKS FUCKIN AWESOME THE WHOLE THING LOOKS AWESOME. HYPE: ENGAGED. ,1
there is zero reason for a remake - we all saw how ghost in a shell went,1
Your what?,2
">  They have to know they will never hit numbers like that again without Marvel, so why not just sell it? and then that EDIT. It pisses me off some people are able to get upvoted so much even if what they said really missed the whole story. Its like twitter/facebook over again. Good job for that edit tho",3
Ya see?  DO YOU SEE?  We never needed Captain Marvel.  At all!  Pointless!  Thor could have ripped apart the same ship she did!  Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy did we have to introduce an overpowered superhero at the last minute for the 2nd half of a concluding epic series?,1

Why the fuck is the avengers a in fallen and not avenge who did this ,1
He never needed forgiveness in the first place.,1

Alexander pull through I hope at least you'll have a kid to continue on your legacy. ,1
"I can see where you're coming from, and even agree with you on some aspects. The energy in the theater during the final battle in Endgame was pretty damn cool, I'll give you that. I just think the negatives outweigh the positives in this case.",1
Idk why but he kinda look like Hawkeye...,1
"Dude, I have to know where your local AMC is, I have never seen anyone important in my local AMC or Epic theaters.",1
"What plans can you announce for the LGBT community?   As part of an underserved community, I as a fan gravitated so heavily to movies like Black Panther.  What that movie did in portraying Black culture in a completely new and novel light was completely groundbreaking.

"Yup again, I m speaking as someone that likes all this shit. For different reasons.  Find it hilarious how one joke Poe made about space nazi gleeson s mom somehow is some sort of sacrilege towards Star Wars,",2
I'm hoping it just means he's gonna have a cameo in Spider-Verse 2,1
X-Men in the MCU?,1
But it's still referred to as a realm whereas Midgard is a realm. Isn't Midgard pretty much the rest of the galaxy as well? Maybe I'm projecting what I know about the comics onto the MCU. But Asgard doesn't even look like a planet in the MCU.,1

Make the previous 2 movies  film in a film  status, but have Wade himself acknowledge how well they characterised him. Instantly know the character, but his exploits are then non-canon. Easy.",2
Hey Kevin! You once said that the only franchise you d rather lead over Marvel would be Star Wars given the opportunity. Is this still something you d like to explore or are you sticking with Marvel given how well that s going?,1
So Captain America s got flow now??,1
Yeah I'm 29 years old and Thor in Endgame is the first superhero I ever really connected with in that way. I have felt like he did. Even the Mom stuff hit home with me. When he finally says  Yeah yeah I'm from the future...but I just REALLY need to talk to you  I cried.,2

probably not that much. likely around 10k,1
Kevin thanks for doing this. I grew up with the MCU throughout my childhood and I am  honored to have witnessed the growth of the MCU from the very first film in Iron Man to the most recent film in Avengers Endgame. My question to you is how long do you think the MCU will last as a franchise and do you see the MCU as a franchise with the potential to span 50+ years with all the Marvel characters we haven't been introduced to yet?,1
There's videos of him chris pratt and rdj on set filming. ,1

Also my point was going through someone's past especially from years ago isn't always Indicitive of what kind of person they are today,1
Or they push one into the next year,2
What marvel movie that isn't currently planned would you love to see at some point?,1
That's cause they used one of their known PR stooges to write the initial article that blamed Disney.  This is that fuck Tom Rothman acting like an asshat. https://youtu.be/ 1 EOkShdQs,1

"Seeing as a shield similar to this one with just Stan Lee goes for  525, it's probably worth 1 or 2 grand.",1
"Even with the timeline aside, it would be really cluttered with characters. For Strange 2, we've already got Wong, Wanda, probably Loki, Strange himself, and the antagonists (assuming its not Wanda or Loki). Add Spidey and that's a lot of major Avengers to have in a non-Avengers film.",1

You still have to buy the lot. At San Francisco prices.,2

And then at the end Spidey mutates into a big spider and starts eating people as well which makes them best buddies! (But I seriously want giant mutated Spidey though. That was one of my favourite Spidey arcs in the 90s cartoon),2
Whence is Gamora?,1
"yes. and if you watch interviews,  her voice is naturally a bit lower. but as  TechniChara (url) says it could be the audio processing. I hope it's on the lower side in the actual movie. glad others noticed, too, tho. edit: actually it could also be that she goes lower while talking casually and while in a movie a coach reminds her to go naturally higher. or they just wanted to go higher here to (stupidly) broadcast vulnerabiity  i just read way into this, i stop now ",1

"This could go a really interesting direction, actually, by starting with Thor re-enforcing that idea, (basically quote that line at the start) and then coming to understand that there's a level of 'magic' that goes beyond Asguardian science. Thor stories get a lot of distance by challenging Thor's ego and pushing him to rise to a new challenge.",2

"Hello, thanks for your time answering our questions.  My question is in hindsight, what changes, if any, would you have made to the MCU? Plot alterations, character changes?  Thank you for your time, and thank you for your great contributions to the MCU.",1
We did have somewhat of backstory though. I think the fact that her character is better in the comics would point to what I'm saying. Her MCU portrayal just isn't good.,1

I d have much rather seen Hulk/Thanos rematch with a properly enraged Hulk.,1
Winter soldier suit?,1
"What if the current MCU is the  no more mutants  reality, and bringing them back is basically undoing what Wanda did?",1
FUCK YEA I literally jumped up from the chair I was sitting in. I m in a public library. It was not subtle,1
"I'd say  TAHITI  (Season 1, episode 14) is a good place to start, the recap should cover everything you need to know and it introduces some important characters, then jump forward to  Turn, Turn, Turn  (Season 1, Episode 17) which is the tie-in with Winter Soldier and is where the story really kicks off. From then on the show is generally very good.",3
With disney I'm sure they could make her a teenager again.,1

"Lmao dude Jennifer Anniston was in one of (or is it the single) most successful sitcoms of all time, and is still making  2,000,000 **per year** from the show, that ended 15 years ago. She's more successful than a vast majority of the actors in any of the Marvel films, and her job's far easier because she finished it 15 years ago and gets paid more than most/all of they do still. If anything, it's the other way around.",3
The search for Harper Feelsbadman,1
YESSSS. Great decision. ,1
Will the mutants ever join them in the mcu?,1
"No it doesn't but it would just feel like a missed opportunity to include this after her story-arch is over. If this doesn't serve a purpose for the next arc, then they shouldn't have been so hesitant about a female-led film before Captain Marvel, and should have released this at some point before Endgame.",1
Seeing Stark with the rest just made my day.  https://imgur.com/mYDZJfk (url),1
But Red Sparrow stole that story line.,3
"I just don't know how hyped we are for Suicide Squad 2... obviously having Gunn direct it makes me more interested than I would've been, but I think I'd rather Suicide Squad 2 got a new director and Gunn went to work on GotG2 right away.  But obviously obligations and contracts are important so I understand.",1
Can we get a Luis recap of Infinity War and/or Endgame?,1
It's a Galaxy Quest reference. The line is  By Grabthar's hammer.... what a savings ,3
"There are some leaked set pics that iirc he isn t in, but strongly imply a situation where he d be just off camera, and probably on screen in scenes surrounding the one being shot. >!The Battle Of New York from Avengers 1 is apparently going to be refought - not only was the scenery similar, but there was Cap in his dumb Avengers 1 costume - but this time Ant-Man is there. Time travel shenanigans FTW!! ",2
Yeah I wanted to see if the rest of your post history was as sad and pathetic as your attitude in this thread. Seems like you re pretty consistent with your worthlessness,1
I was hoping it would be Captain America and the Avengers. Featuring pale Vision.,3
A lot can happen between now and then.,1
So that's how Tony meets Captain Marvel? She rescues him on her way back to earth. ,1
"Ahh, that makes sense.",1
They don't need the buyer to work with them at all. The spider-man rights revert back to marvel if sony pictures is ever sold.,2
It's fun to fucking talk about on a message board though.,2
"The difference here being that Franken physically groped women. He didn't tweet it, like he physically touched women inappropriately.  I voted for the man and he had to go. ",3
Many producers only do just a couple of those things and only the most powerful ones do all of that. The amount of influence they have varies a lot.,1
Do you like the mcu casting in general? Did you like Taika's take on Thor with Ragnar k? Have a little goddamn faith Arthur!,1
"Times may be tough, so it s a good thing you re tougher",2

Unlike some other Keanu Reeves.,1
No problem. What parts of Vol. 2 make it so much better than Vol. 1 in your opinion?,1
"Personally I have a feeling it'll be like how the MCU movies have treated the pre-DisneyPlus TV movies: In continuity, but rarely if ever directly referenced.",1
"I just couldn't get over the bad writing. They're fighting an Asgardian woman that they know can control men's minds, so they send their best man with all the knowledge of their systems to one side of the building to enter alone. This is the best intelligence agency in the world. The focus on young people on the team was frustrating. Lots of things. Anyway, I see a lot of people saying I should keep going.",1
wow that does look cool!!!,1
"Name me the literal pedos please. Like convicted pedos. Because I can namr Democrats as well, or are we still pretending this is a political affliation issue? ",3
"Thor, Hulk, and Wanda, basically no point.  They are arguably more powerful than Tony even with his most advanced suit. Vision basically is also a Tony creation. Cap pretty much kicked Tony's ass when Tony had a suit and Cap didn't, at end of Civil War, and has a pretty cool indestructible shield. Tony *does* give Spider Man a suit. Leaves Clint and Natasha.  Would be fun to get the directors head canon on why Tony didn't give them suits.",2
RIP Stan - never hits you till it hits you. You did a lot for a lot of people ,1
I wonder how many cameos they have in the can? It ll be great to see him in Ant Man part 4,1
Same. Dude is just so entertaining to listen to. ,3
His partner is Sax   together they form a  great vampire squid  that sucks all the money out of the economy. Unfortunately Phil Spiderman never brings them to justice.,1
Only Gunn can direct GOTG the way it should be. Glad he s back,1

People can change. Just because someone said something a while back doesn t mean that they still support what they said.,1
u/Alextingzon ,1
"James Cameron about to take a full page ad, in a newspaper that we will see a photo off online, to congratulate Avengers.",3
"That's only part of his talent, and fairly uniquely suited for the MCU. The other part is that he spent his time learning that trade and can oversee massive productions and know when to delegate/when to step in.",3
"Shut up, Wesley.",1
It was. She was still there tho.,1
Have you lived in a bowl? The Marvel Cinematic Universe has 20 films out,2
Remember that starwars lightsaber kid from the early days? The only difference between him and Chris Hemsworth is production value.,1
compared to its budget yes it did make bad money for a spiderman film.,1
And then he goes and gives one to Spider-Man,1
Oof... Marvel you beautiful bastard. ,1
"What kind of person see others happy, and feels the need to ruin that joy?",2
The titanfall 2 campaign,1
That looks like a drawing,1
I hope this means that Gunn will still take his place kind of running the cosmic side of Marvel as originally planned. I know he'll be doing suicide squad first. But I hope he sticks around with the MCU after GotG3. I am so happy he gets to finish his trilogy though. Both GotG 1 and 2 are in my top list of MCU films. ,1
"If you build something tiny with normal materials them blow it up to 1000x, will the molecules that make up that material also be enlarged? Like resizing a tiny image will make it pixelated, you would need to use certain filters to smooth it out or upscale it. If this is done with physical matter, does it also create new matter to make up for that scale? If you blew up Ant-Man to the size of the Sun would we be able to hold his DNA in our hands like a snake?",1
My guess from the trailer is that the Old Lady have been very rude to her,1
"Nah we're only on a marvel subreddit, I'm sure he pulled that number from nowhere, randomly",3
"No, he has a new costume in Avengers 4, too. It's more in line with the original Avengers costume but a little more updated and tactical looking I think (sort of combining the look of that costume with the costumes from Age of Ultron and Winter Soldier.",1
"Oh Holland is great , I don't like what MCU did with him and I didn't appreciate the director who made his first two movies. I was tired of Peter Parker living in Stark's shadow, even after he's dead. I just don't think either movie did even a decent job with the action.",1
"sm deal now is the third movie and 1 mcu apperance,i think july 2023 will be f4",1
Jesus Christ look at the amount of gold he/she received.,1
Agree.  Its disturbing that its a real thing,3
Hi Kevin. Who would win in a fight 1 rhino sized goose or one regular sized rhino? Alternatively it s the goose vs 25 goose sized rhinos,1
"Fan service that is earned ia the best kind. It's the culmination of 11 years, of course it's gonna have nostalgia.",1
Made up circumstances and factors you perceived. Everyone sees that but you and the vocal minority,1
"I am of the opinion that mob mentality, especially as it is amplified by the internet, is one of the greatest threats we face as a society. This man clearly said some wrong and frankly disgusting things in the past which he accepts and has apologized for, but most importantly, he has grown to become a better person. Does personal growth and improvement not count for something anymore?",1
... the person is responsible for the kazoo's key...?,1
"I m talking strictly performance. Terrence is a bit of an ass, from what I understand.",0
"Agreed. The way I see it, though, he hasn't got any reason to be putting on an act. He doesn't need to rehabilitate his image or something. The most controversial thing he's done is make parenting mistakes, which he owned and the whole thing ended up being more of an extended discussion about safely carrying babies, so it was good. And his response was completely understandable, carried the perfect tone, and made sense. Honestly, it doesn't seem like anything other than just who he is.",1
"It's funny, I actually thought the Ant-Man movies were pretty weak entries. **But**. I fucking love everyone in them and think the chemistry involved is off the charts.",3
Imagine boasting about something so strange online and other people having the freedom to dare comment on it.,0
MY BOY HAWKEYE EDIT I KNOW ITS RONIN IM JUST EXCITED FOR THE BEST MAN AROUND,1
"Who is the guy who does this ,  , to Doctor Strange?",1
I was thinking about that the other day. The fact that Strange had to use the exact spells at the right time in order to get the desired outcome. If he did something slightly different it would have ruined everything.,3
REM on MTV,1
"honestly, the less screen time with captain plank's wooden personality and forgettable delivery of everything she ever does, the better.",0
"You AREn'T? I would think that, now, more than ever, you'd be ready.",1
Which version is he anyway?,1
 Mr. Stark,1
There are dead baby joke books for fucks sake.  Our society has become thin-skinned pussies.,3
"Yes, and the Guardians are lamer versions of the Avengers, who themselves are lamer versions of the Justice League, yet Marvel made them all into household properties. All characters can sound lame if you look at them like that. Clearly Marvel disagrees. Hence, the unpopular.",3
So much yes in this photo!,2
IN A CAVE! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS!,2
"Holy sheet, this thread goes deeper than James Cameron did",1
You were correct,1
You re an absolute angel for this!,1
Cross the line? I ugly cried the whole stinkin movie :(,2
I never really thought about it this way but if they use the shows like this it will be definetly to their advantage,1
"Talking shit about you director is a toxic move in Hollywood, whether he got fired or not",1
"Even better question, did the phone get dusted with her? If it didn't did he just keep it in the exact same spot so if in case she ever comes back she can get to it?",1
Chuckled at that thought too lol. It's been a long time coming!,3
"I mean, I can see why. Disney has had a really rough decade. They need every percentage point. Disney has most of the money in circulation now. Can't stop now. Most is not all.",0
HeY dOnT asK mE OuT BecAUsE yOu Are AtTraCteD tO MebThATs iLLeGal anD SeXisT,1
No? Disney paid 8 millions for Marvel and Star wars COMBINED and you want them to pay 10 for spider-man? No shareholder is gonna approve this.,2
"The only moment I got caught off guard, more than Natasha's and Tony's death because I expected those two (fucking spoilers), and sobbed into the credits because there's a happy ending for our lonely Cap eventually.",1
"Wow this is Hela's true strength, truly any guys weakness. Oh and great cosplay by the way.",1
I don't really see how that is the same thing at all. The comics are not canon to the movies. ,1
They can't even make the 5 years older reference since it's an MCU reference.,1
"Mr. Feige, who is the superhero your proudest to bring to the big screen, and who is the superhero you most look forward to bringing to the big screen?",1
Not wanting Spider-Man to be gay doesn't make you a homophobe.,3
yeah definitely this. The background is a VFW from the looks of it ,3
" We have to give everything, even if that means our lives. We will stop at nothing. We will fight for the lost. (That isn't in the trailer, but goddamn it felt like it should be.) ",1
Will the mcu ever have an official ending?,1
Those kids will remember that for the rest of their lives. Kudos.,1
Seems like they are definitely focusing more on Cap this time. The movie is less than 3 months away and we don't know much about anything!,2
How me and my girlfriend are gonna be looking at each other when I make her breakfast in bed tomorrow even though she's sick with the flu,1
I can t tell if you re being sarcastic or not ,2
"Thanos isn't from another realm. Hopefully Strange learned his mistake, though.",1
"Title it  Budapest . Make it a super spy, James Bond style movie with marvel flair with her and Hawkeye as the protagonists. Tons of great villains to choose from. If they are going to make a Widow movie, I see that as the only real route. It would give the references to Budapest weight + we would get to see why Widow is so untrustworthy and see a more brutal Hawkeye. To top it off  make it the first R rated movie in the MCU. Kids aren t huge fans of Widow so they don t really need to sell toys.",0
Hopefully the delay can help James improve the script and cinematography of the movie.,1
Is this from the Endgame concept art book?,1
You're the only person that's given me a pretty sane response. Good on ya.,1
"They will remember that moment forever, and that was so great of the cast to do that for them.",1
any v.reddit mirror? anyone please as youtube is blocked atm.,1
TONY MAKES IT BACK TO EARTH!!!,1
"I'm sorry, what? I don't understand.",1
Your reminder is here!,2
"He literally has terminal cancer, I'd hardly call that lucky.",3
"There have been a lot of examples of failed cinematic universes and even failed trilogies or other series. The MCU has had 22 very successful films and even the worst amongst them hasn't derailed the series itself.  Do you have any thoughts on why it seems to be so hard for others to build a connected film series when the MCU has been so successful? Does it have to do with the IP, the target audience, or maybe just the showrunners? Thank you for your time, today and every day since (before) 2008.",2
LEGIT,1
"This is wonderful!! I was searching through the comments for your product list until I finally realized this is marvelstudios, not makeupaddiction.  (But you should crosspost it there, they'll love it too!)",1
It s past your bed time little guy,2
It's so weird seeing these arguments about me,3
"I honestly thought they were the same costume tbh.  But I prefer the 1st one, as it looks pretty awesome. The second costume kinda feels a little too simple, as it's just a red coat. At least the 1st one had some details.",3
Fucking sensational,1
"Am I the only one who noticed that little clip where photo holograms of the missing people are passing... We see Scott Lang and Peter Parker, but we also see Shuri! Please don t tell me she was snapped too!",1
Because he actually directs stories based off of unique screenplays. You sometimes make boring or unsuccesful ones. He doesn't directive derivative superhero crap,1
"They're defending not getting fired over extremely old digital history. Fucking George Carlin has said worse, the most famous comedian in history. Why does making shitty jokes that were replies to someone mean he's a pedophile IRL. We've all said bad stuff we don't actually believe while anon, knowing we'd never say or think that shit if other people where in front of us. His mistake is that he was too dumb to realize Twitter isn't anon. ",3
Twitter of course. ,1
"Too much, too soon, IMO. Maybe one or two of the above. If Loki and Scarlet Witch are gonna be in it, then having all of the above in it too - in a 120 - 130 minute film - would render it overcrowded and unmanageable, IMO. Leave some material for a third installment.",2
He should trade in his shield for an AR-15. He would take out so many more bad guys,3
This is totally something you could post without the spoiler and all those that didn't watch it would just be confused,1
Would it be easy to hide from doctors in case I'm hospitalized at the end?,2
"Crazy how amazing  Iron Man: 2008  holds up to today s era, and love how advance the tech in that film is, still ahead of our time yet believable.",3
 i got you buddy (url),3
"Same, i literally jumped just of pure joy reading this",2
>Not exactly sure what changed my opinion You grew up.,1
"It actually reinforces those criticisms.  They only used the Avengers' theme because it's the only, and I do mean only, piece of music that's even remotely memorable. It doesn't fit the trailer at all, with all the atmospheric tones of despair and loss, yet using triumphant music because it's the only music they have to use.",0
"***HEY GUYS LEAVE A COMMENT, LIKE, SUBSCRIBE, AND HIT THAT BELL IF YOU WANT TO BE ENTERED INTO THE NEXT ROUND OF THE FLASH RING GIVEAWAY***",2
Atem and the other 5 leads come out of a portal to help fight Thanos,2
Didn't he direct Ragnarok?,1
Does Disney require you to have an implant that will stop your heart immediately if you try to spoil anything?,3
You typed .jpg in the file name so now it will display as .jpg.jpg,1
"An MCU film, not just any film",1
Holy cow - this is absolutely brilliant! The editing is superb and probably way better than what some of the Avengers movies have themselves!,1
"Oh shit, now he s gonna get fired too",2
"How hilarious would it be if the whole movie Tony Stark is just stuck in space... then dies. That's it.The whole time Dr. Strange was looking through the future he was trying to find one where Tony dies, not Thanos losing.  On a more serious note, how could Doctor Strange see past his own death in the snappening when The Ancient One couldn't see past her's? ",1
"How are you doing, man? It's been a little while.",1
Who could really fry our brains at this point? Fantastic four done right? X-Men?,3
I m stuck with two of them for the rest of my life.,1
"I want a montage of Thor appearing all over Earth looking for the battle. 1. New York:  BRING ME THANOS! Oh... it s quiet. 2. Tony s house:  BRING ME oh, hey, Pepper. 3. Avenger s HQ:  Bring me.... nope. 4. SHIELD HQ:  ..... nope. 5. Wakanda:  BRING ME THANOS! ",3
I mean if you have been married 70 years chances are you ain't gonna make it much further regardless ,2

What is this comment lol,1
Ya know I was really hoping fury would swoop in with a helicarrier but then I remembered thanos has his warship hovering over the battlefield..... it would immediately blow up the helicarrier.,3
What happened to rainn Wilson ,1
So you mean he s been granted a seat on the council but not sorcerer supreme,3
"He's Alan Moore. Kind of his thing. Starting to think nobody here actually read Watchmen,",0

So *shes* to blame for Captain Marvel,0
Any update on yours yet?,1
"Ah, I see. To be honest, I feel the same way about that person's attitude",1

He doesn't know it necessarily but I've adopted rdj as my father. I dont get to see him but he's busy I get it,3
"Yes, Trying to trick 60+ year olds into thinking a superhero movie with a talking raccoon and time travel is a heartfelt drama will do wonders for Endgame's Oscar chances.",3
it's been established in the first Avengers that Banner can't die. i think the quote was  I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out ,1
Because they started on Universal s Incredible Hulk. Universal fully own that version of things.,0
That's absurd. We are introduced to the concept of Infinity Stones by a video of the power stone alone destroying an entire planet.,1
 notmy90s,3
"I watched the movie Sunday, felt sorta Deus ex Machina-ish to me, just because she played no part in like two and a half hours of the movie and then was brought back for that small area.",1
  Pietro..,1
I think a really neat detail is that the only person we ever see with Tony's full suit tech (besides himself) is pepper.,1
"like he didn't lobby with these cast members to try and make this pull for him. I'm sure they wanted to anyways, but if you think Gunn said  no, don't , you're fooling yourself. and out of curiosity, how did you (and these cast members) react to Trump's pussy tape?",0
He and captain marvel are the key links for humans and space.,3
He was willing to sacrifice millions AND MILLIONS of dollars and give up on one of his most successful roles because he saw some bullshit and wasn't willing to just look the other way. He seems like a genuinely nice person and not just for his image.,1
He's too small to see,3
"Hey Carol! Pleasure to see you, congratulations on your success, welcome to the MCU! Can't wait to see Rogue kill you in ten years!",3
"Endgame spoilers >!When GiAnt Man just fucking punches one of the Leviathans in the face, and takes it out is one of my favorite moments in that whole battle scene! ",3
Wow. What a bad idea. This will backfire BigTime. Oh well. ,0
MY NaME Is PEteR ParKER,3
Thats an effing awesome movie.  An orgasmic conclusion,1
This looks amazing. And you look like a Jake gyllenhal/Sam Rockwell cross. I think you win the gene pool for that one man,1
Isn t it deliberate though? She is supposed to be  flawed   after all.,2
Could be Loki in disguise....maybe to give Thor time to eacape?,3
Also Dr. Strange set up a serious of conditions that ultimately led to his sacrifice. Granted it was the only way to win but I can see Strange upset that he had to let Tony die.,3
Yes but there is a difference between a teenager and a 40 year old man.,1
"I meam, yeah, clint kneeled first, but normaly when someone dies, you don't kneel, clint did because he had some kind of ninja training, and that's probably what they learned him to do, and when he kneeled, T'chala was like:  Yeah that's probably an appropiate thing to do, then captain marvel, and then the rest kneeled, i think, that's why it looked kinda forced",1
I like how Tom Holland sounds like a helpless 15 year old trying to figure out the industry but he is actually in his 20s,3
He does a LOT of autographs and has ever since he got with WWE. Dude has the prettiest hand writing for hands that big,2
I wonder what Feige is thinking / saying behind closed doors / if he was even consulted before Alan Horn fired one of his directors. AFAIK he hasn't made any public statement?  ,1
NUT NUT NUT,1
It's great but mans forgot the incredible hulk,1
Could you link to it? I'd love to read about what happened and know that its accurate,3
So like why couldnt they just portal in their armies from Earth to Titan to all fight Thanos?,1
"low key flex 6th from the left, front row",1
"It'll be a result of some time travel shenanigans from Deadpool 2 I imagine. That way he'll be able to reference the other two films and characters contextually. Not that he can't if they don't do this, considering yknow, Deadpool.",1
"I don't play video games, so I wouldn't no. But I would at least expect the big bad guy to factor in to the plot of the game. Hence why they are the BIG BAD",2
Plus all of the Wakandan ships.,3
Me too. it was fun. Love seeing that pure joy.,3
"TBH Pepper using the suit so comfortably didn't make any sense. But hey, Rule of Cool.",2
"Well, that was hostile. Thanos found out the avengers were time traveling. He didn t flip his shit or anything, he was just like  okay, gotta deal with this now . Time travel had already been done multiple times in the MCU. It makes sense that he didn t see it as that much of a deal. And I don t have a narrative. I asked a question. Drop the hostility.",1
"Exactly, same logic for the Marvel shows being in a separate timeline from the MCU movies.",1
"Pretty sure he's a Tolkien fan, so that might have played a part.  Most Tolkien fans didn't care for the Hobbit movies so much.  It was easy for me to not be upset by it (no one was forcing me to watch it), but he'd already signed a contract to do three movies.",1
Yep Sharon is dusted.  ,3

"Yeah, so glad OP left it out. Was questioning whether they'd reveal the title during the trailer.",2

A nice soda or iced tea then. Share some pizza with him.,3

FINALLY  THANOS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR  THE TRAILER IS HERE,1
"Hulk and Bruce are the same character, Banner didn't kill anyone. He simply wanted to be whole. Hulk and Banner are always fighting for control over their body, it's been like that ever since he turned into the Hulk for the first time. They're always at odds no matter what I like to think of it as a sort of spiritual journey for Bruce, you can't beat a big villain if YOU are your biggest villain. He didn't KILL Hulk, he just accepted that Hulk was a part of him. Hulk is Bruce and Bruce is Hulk.",3
"Okay, but like, you do know that s impossible right?",3
Part of the journey is the end. Oh man I'm gonna throw lines from this trailer every moment I can until we get another one!,1
"Right, just takes these trailers and the scenes in movies it appears in to another level. ",3

"Yeah I mean the great thing for me personally is going to MCU movies I m kinda insulated for talking, my family all pretty much goes together and it s 28 seats we re all filling up so the whole area around me is usually quiet and i saw endgame the second time with them (couldn t wait so saw it opening night on Thursday) and holy crap I missed sooo much dialogue from randoms talking, people screaming etc. So I totally get why people hate going to the cinema to watch a movie especially one like this",1
"So I heard if his co-stars make him look good, RDJ buys them strippers and coke.",0

"Well, it was reported that Disney executive(s) were the ones that told ABC to not even consider to cancel the show. It was never reported on the who and why but it was (I remember) that they buried it in like the last paragraph about their article about how shitty the Inhumans were and how it created a strain between ABC and Marvel.",1

"Homecoming begins by replaying the events of Civil War, then skips two months later.",1
"Guess you better not go see the movie then. Edit: Also it's not his armor from Civil War. It's more bleeding edge/Extremis armor. So it forms to his body, hence looking like a jumpsuit.",1
ha i believe that's why they had to invent the field of  super physics  to handle these kinds of things.. but you're saying that you don't think our universe is any more or less susceptible to the forces of darkness than pre-snap?,1
I love how subtle it is too. It s like an inside joke between Scott and Hope and then also everyone at the movie theater,3
I remember that he was important and that he had some villain stuff going on at the end of Dr. Strange but I forgot his name and didn t feel like looking it up. Comic him seems like an entirely different character. ,2

A meme from what dude? I'm a pretty heavy subscriber to atheism and I've never heard this,0
"Russos also outright said that Endgame wouldn't be the title. If he hadn't said outright that it's not gonna happen, all the blogs would start running articles about how this character is showing up and it would ruin the surprise.

"If they used the comics outfits, literally everyone would be constantly pulling the wedgies out of their cracks.",2
Isn t he kinda short for a stormtrooper?,3
"except in the comics he was so powerful he could basically do anything, one of the strongest characters.  And from what I understand there doesn't seem to be any magic power cap or something like that. it all depends on your brain.  So if he gets it to the point of being instinctual it wouldn't detriment him at all. ",2
Why is the green arrow talking about Marvel? I thought he was from DC,1
" No, I m that too (https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sfIJujRg0/?igshid=1e0paqvags69g)",3
Or maybe Wandavision since Monica will be in it,1
"Hello Kevin, the world you and your team constructed practically in a cave with a box of scraps has shaped my childhood. So I just wanted to ask you if there was any experience which demonstrated how surreal it was for a dream you once had to evolve into a worldwide phenomenon. Thank you so much.",1
It s pronounced *Thanos*,3
Shapiro isn t an extreme conservative besides probably abortion and he is a little wild there I ll give you that. He criticizes Trump and doesn t pull any punches with other conservative commentators. Shapiro has been a political commentator since before he was 20 years old so I guess his attitude and the way he carries himself is reflective of the constant shit he has gotten for years. ,3
"This is more in MCU. The Kree created inhumans to be soldiers. When the Kree Empire cancelled the experimentation programs, they set about exterminating the  abominations  they created.",3
that's gotta be it. ,1
13 Hours and Jack Ryan really cemented his action acting chops in my book.,3
Endgame: hand over the throne because you're not cut out for Kingship and we need more 'fun Thor' sequels,1
"Jon is just like Stannis except, y'know, he wouldnt burn his own children alive",2
Mr. Sunday movies here I come!,3
Salty sweet. It's amazing. Same with certain salty chips. Thought it was crazy til I tried it.,3
I would watch the x-men movie. But only if they managed not to make their message hamfisted and eye roll worthy. Like the A-force scene in Endgame,0
He could have been dressed as Ant-Man...,1
Where is the fist bump?,1
remindme! 2 hours,1
I can t believe I ve met someone on here who agrees with me. I honestly think she is wrong for the role. I do wish Emily Blunt didn t have to back out of the Black Widow role but Scarlett Johansson has grown on me over the years.,1
Yeah I read the title of the video and thought... it's just Avengers without  The ?,3
"Kev, thankyou so much for all your effort and crazy hard work. You are our lord and savior. Just wanted to know what did you think about Spider-man Into the Spider-verse, could we please get Tom Holland Spider-man connected with that. It would be such a fantastic thing to see Tom, Ps4 spidey and possibly Raimi Spider-man on the screen at the same time. Pretty please.",1
"Hello Sir,huge fan of your contribution for comic book movies. I have no question,i just have a small request,you have already given us the world,still i am asking you one more thing and that is Justice For Cyclops",1
Did that already.,1
That s a good way to put it. Everything that could go wrong definitely went wrong in infinity war. Good reply.,1
FUCKKKKKIRNSKDFJEISNFIDDJD I WAS ON THE METRO WHEN I SAW THE IG POST AND I WAS LEGIT SCREAMING PEOPLE WERE STARING LMFAO IDC ENDGAME IS HERE KDKFKSJDN,1
Well Shuri got dusted....,1
 The fuck does he want now? (url),1
why is she working night shift?,1
Am I the only one seeing Jacksepticeye here?,2
"I thought that was Bree at the shooting range at first, but the second time through I realized it was Natasha. That makes a lot more sense and fits the trailer better, but I am a little disappointed that there's no CM footage. Oh well, they'll eventually release a super spoilery trailer that will have CM in it.",1
Spider-verse is the best idea ever now,1
yeah but my monitor isnt blue ray so how can i really tell the difference if u think about it,1
I demand an Infinity War trailer Ragnarok style,1
Rosanne was recently makimg racist 'jokes'. James Gunn's was dredged up from 10 years ago. Rosanne's 'joke' was not clearly about plastic surgery. If you recall she blamed her racism on taking Ambien.  Stop defending racists. ,2
Looking forward to the awkward Nebula Stark friendship. > my dad was kinda an asshole too ya know,1
"Remember when Thanos called Nebula a 'waste of parts'?..   Well, now looks like Tony got a 'box of scraps' and 'extra parts' to work with this time!! Lol.",2
"This. I got a notification in my phone which I didn't read carefully, then I read it again and nearly jumped out of shock. And this is the first time ever I'm sitting and continuously hurting from these type of news.",2
"Awesome pic, keep them coming.",1
Well this is an ad,0
I'm down for that as long as he doesn't add his crappy jokes because they have such bad timing in Ragnarok.,0
"Phase 3 hasn't had a misstep yet, we're already past things being too good to be true, might as well go the full mile.",1
Birth control and education? What are you even talking about?,1
"That s a myth, just FYI. ",0
Such a good series,1
They make suspiciously good Roku TVs,1
if there's something the 2 trailers did it's get me hyped for tony and nebula,3
"It's like using a machine gun to put the holes in swiss cheese. I love cheese, and I love this.",1
"Hello!  So, a lot of people are asking some really awesome questions about the greater MCU, but I was more just wondering what your favorite MCU movie is, and why?",1
* Cap : Soldier * War machine : Soldier * Tony : Sold Weapons * Natasha : Spy (Assassin ? I don't remember too well) * Banner : Probably killed a bunch of people as Hulk * Rocket : Likes to steal body parts * Hawkeye : Probably didn't do too well as Ronin Ironically the only one who could judge her is Ant-Man.,3
"so the gray area doesn't involve running around naked thru people's back yards f'd on heroin?     jk, love RDJ, and as awesome as the comic book stuff is, really looking forward to when his main focus is on other projects again. incomparable, amazing actor.",3
Someone has a short attention span and didn't watch the entire trailer.,1
https://youtu.be/PIomZQyymAY,1
How do you blur the photo for spoilers? Is that a moderator thing?,1
This gave me chils,1
We saw him use it to escape after the Snap. ,2
Captain Marvel incoming to kick some sweet Purple ass!,3
So funny I was watching Iron Man on Netflix and this trailer comes out. ,1
"Damn what a trooper, thank you for your contributions to this record that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside",1
Oooof but true.,2
Daredevil is a dark character. A Daredevil story should picture him as a dark character and not tone him down to be blind Spider-Man.,2
I'm going to just have to start sending Disney/Marvel my entire paycheck at this point lol,3
pl*E*A***SE TELL US WHY YOU HAD TO HIDE AWAY FOR SO LONG***,3
I'm not crying you're crying!!!!,1
The people that want D+ to flop are probably the same ones that think Apple is going to lose the smartphone market or that Call of Duty is going to stop with annual releases. It's not going to happen anytime soon and its best to just work with it and make consumer choices.,1
I hope it has a memorial at the end or something...,2
"That still counts. Any Marvel property, be it from Marvel Studios or Marvel Entertainment can be set within the MCU.",0
Lol. I caught that. YOU AINT WOOOOOSHIN ME TODAY,1
"Idk I think we will soon forget this lad and never thing of him again. So many sick kids, not enough genies granting wishes. ",1
I'm rooting for Thanos.  ,1
I love watching people react to that scene..,1
Where is this from? First time seeing this.,1
"Hello, Kevin. What number is the MCU Universe referred to? Is it 199999 or 616 like in the new Spider-Man clip?",1
r/foundthemobileuser,1
Hi Kevin! I love everything you ve done with the MCU! My question for you is in regards to Westfield high school. I am also an alumni of that school and was wondering what you thought about your time there and if you ever come back to Westfield at all?,1
He commented about the situation after the fact. He didn t try to get her fired.,2
No...,1
Someone saw new rockstars,1
"Well yeah, he guided a nuclear missile through a portal into outer space with no expectations of living..... in the very first avengers movie.",1
"Your former sister, of course.",3
"This post is at the very top of all posts in this sub! Wow, I can t believe this. We have had unbelievable announcements and trailers and yet, a trilogy of Thor posters is the most upvoted. Incredible. ",1
 Lets all be weird and kneel  - everyone apparently,1
"Yeah, he'll hang around in a consulting/smart guy role, now that Tony is dead.",1
*heartbeat increases* ,3
"They did, but Season 1 is available on the DC Universe streaming service.",1
Don't you mean the Men in Black?,1
Too soon... ,3
"Wait so are there going to be two different versions of Tom Holland, or are they going to write Tom Holland into that universe?  I really wish they d just use these villain movies to continue TASM to avoid confusion and finish that storyline off. It would make for a sick Spider-Verse movie.",1
"At the risk of being wooooshed... I think the point of that scene was that the elevator *would* go up despite being  not worthy.  This was Steve/Tony s argument for why Vision could lift it. He s a machine, like the elevator, so both can  lift  the hammer because the enchantment doesn t apply to machines.",3
Sony has a reputation for making shite movies. Disney has a reputation for making good movies. People want to see good movies. It's pretty simple math as to why Sony is being painted as the bad guy.,2
We found the guy who knows nothing about distribution,0
What s your thought process on what makes Marvel movies more successful than other hero franchises? Is it the self-conscious way you can poke fun at the genre instead of taking yourselves too seriously? A+ actors? Exploring themes that are more complex and rich than simple good/evil dichotomies? Or something else?,1
im so hyped i cant even bother to type properly,1
Shield machine broke.,3
> She looks exactly like what you would think of when you think  Lady Thanos She doesn't have a vagina for a chin so I don't know how true that statement is.,1
"Holy cow, this is masterfully edited and incredibly well done! I got goosebumps watching it",1
> Constantine I would seriously enjoy another Constantine film.,1
"I mean after Bucky fell he turned dark for half a second, this is that 10-fold. He's gonna fuck some shit up",1
Every MCU film has the potential to be the best MCU film lol,1
Reddit sucks,1
you mean Infinity MAy 4,1
"I'd say she's pretty loved here, at least for a character that has had limited screentime in the MCU so far. The  outrage  is from a very small, but loud minority who are easily offended and outraged.",2
Its also a number that is fake as all get out.,0
"Hmmm maybe he shouldn t be criticizing comments, especially since he has made inappropriate comments in the past.",0
But can he see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch? ,2
"Nah. I just don t fit into the reddit dudebro hive mind. Do you sincerely think that the entire marvel fan base shares the common held beliefs of this sub? Absolutely not. You need to think about who Reddit appeals to and what kind of demographic largely uses Reddit, and think about how that forms their opinions. Of course the people on this sub aren t going to accept any criticism or even want to have conversations about representation. They do not care.",1
Let's point our fingers and laugh at this doofus!,2
You sure you didn't just get Cate Blanchett to take the second picture?,1
The beauty is now Disney owns Avatar and can keep it from rerelease to keep Endgame on top!!!!,1
"I think because most of the movie is CGI/green screen, they do the VFX work in 2K. So even if the live action stuff was 4K, everything else would look a little blurry.",1
"Hey man, I know I pulled the trigger. ",1
"Dread it, run from it. Destiny still arrives.",1
As Loki?,1
Congrats! Now you can finally retire,1
>the things he thought were ok to laugh about were pretty gross So he should lose his job?,1
Tony's technology > space giant dwarf,0
A man can only be so errect. ,1
"Hoping if we ever see Daredevil in the MCU again, it ll only be played by Charlie. He IS Daredevil to me and a lot of other people. ",1
"To be fair, there was only one movie in between Ant-Man   The Wasp and Endgame. Unless you count Civil War. But still, a callback to a fairly minor moment",3
There was a whole scene in Iron Man 2 about him developing a new element to power the arc reactor that was derived from Howard's research on the Tesseract.,1
Shit got me emotional ,1
Can't wait for the Photoshop bantz once it overtakes Avatar. Just as well >!Zoe Saldana is even prettier than!  Giant-Man.,1
"Hmm I checked it and you might be right, could also just be unfinished CGI. God I wish this movie would come out tomorrow! The months of speculation is gonna kill me!",1
Thats war machine suit is black and gray under that quantum stuff so rhodey calls it war machine not iron patriot.,1
"Please, one last Captain America with him returning any the stones, and make it campy and ridiculous.!",1
"I'm sorry you are the way you are, and I hope it gets better. ",3
... What was it?,1
I m partly confused if this really is all from the opening 20 minutes. The action scenes and Cap being all tired and dirty make me think it s from much later on. ,1
wow surprised they were willing to do this - how do they get comfortable no spoilers?,1
 1:21 Who is Proxima throwing the spear at?  I can't make it out.,1
His secrets have secrets,1
Brung? Where you from,3
That s a good theory. ,1
 you have to assume its from his wealthy family that bought the house years ago before the market exploded..,1
"Absolutely a personal question that might get overlooked here, but as a writer and content creator I ve drafted everything from treatments to scripts for beloved series (and of course I m a huge Marvel and MCU fan). Even on the Marvel website it talks about unsolicited submissions and how  we ll find you .  So how can a creator get noticed by a studio as large as your own? How do you recruit new talent and fresh minds?",2
"Yes I know that. I was trying to keep it simple since we both know if I typed out  fell beasts  the vast majority of people who have only watched the movies would have no idea what I was talking about. But by saying dragons, then everyone is able to understand the point quickly.  ",2
Yeah the scene of Tony in space from the IW trailer is him from the seconds immediately after Peter dies in his arms. ,2
"Well, all the more for the what if? Show lol",1
i love How Marvel/Sony continually fuck over their most popular character and therefore themselves.,1
">Some people aren't down for an empowered woman on screen Such BS. Alita, Kill Bill, WW, Atomic Blonde, New star wars movies, Alien, I could go on.  It's not about it being a female lead, it's about Brie not performing that great as Danvers. She's good in other roles, but really dropped the ball with CM. Her acting was stiff and bland.",2
Pom's signature is so lazy lol,1
He could mean researching his character and practicing stuff on the weekends. Doesn't necessarily mean on set.,3
Saruman:  For Isengard! ,2
"I'm glad you enjoy the convenience, but I don't think we've caught up yet on the security implications.",1
"I think a lot of them are, at least those that go up against Thanos. ",1
/r/puninternalaffairs officer I m gonna need you to hand me your badge. Pun usage while making an arrest is highly illegal ,3
And the Atom...oh wait.,1
Now i want a Batman spiderman teamup for every reboot theyve done,1
PS: can we have A lot more doctor strange? lol asking for a friend!,2
Very human. It's pretty normal for this stuff to happen.,0
"It was reported that Marvel interviewed 70 directors for this movie but they went with Scarlett's choice of Shortland.  I think this tells us it will not be a typical Marvel popcorn movie.  It will be atmospheric, challenging and dramatic.",3
"Good thing they put red outlines around the inappropriate parts of the jokes. That way I know which parts not to say if my mom is listening. (Also, a few of these are hilarious)",2
"Mine is a cockapoo, looks pretty much the same!",1
Doctor Strange vs Doctor Doom,1
A little awkward,3
These visuals are outstanding even by most trailer standards. I also don't mind for once that it didn't show a lot about the plot. I am super excited for this. ,1
Do you have plans to add the X-Men into the MCU?,1
That s a sweet idea! I m into it,1
"Well, I mean, Thor has that image burned into his retina forever at this point. I'm sure you could just go ask him for what he saw.",1
Karen! ,1
Uncle Ben must have left a huge inheritance for Aunt May and Spidey to afford an apartment in Queens. Or May does modeling for Tony's calendars.,1
Strange being suspended in the air by those icicle things. Thor with his head  in Thanos' hands and Thanos baring down on Cap. Things definitely look bleak for some characters.,3
"5/10 not enough water Puns aside, I love this!",1
Cap is wearing his Winter Soldier suit  3,1
"Alan Moore takes himself way too seriously. He creates superheroes, but thinks himself above anyone who enjoys the genre.  As for the huge popularity of superhero films, I'll be blunt.  It's a crap world and these are difficult and uncertain times. Escapism is a must for us to retain our sanity.",0
"This is phenomenal. Wonderful job, I love it 3000!",1
will someone PLEASE BUZZ SCOTT IN??,1
"Let me guess, what is point break? What is underroos? What is  Cap ? UUUUmmmmmm I don't have any other guesses.",1
Not all animated movies are just for kids.  And Into the Spiderverse is probably Sony's best Spiderman attempt outside of Spiderman 2.,3
RIP to a legendary person,1
"If this is the case then they knew what was coming surely, why end so many seasons with this much cliffhanger this close to the end of that contract? ",1
*Back in Black starts playing* wait... wrong carracter,3
This comment wins,1
I still want Krasinski/Blunt as Reed and Susan Richards.,3
"No. I have a very similar story, my wife, 33, was diagnosed in November with lung cancer and has until April. She looks absolutely *fine*.",3
>We shouldn t have to debate over validity of canon in the first place. Then quit crying.,1
"It is not, it is Brie Larson's voice.",2
Thanks mate! I never cared about downvoting.,0
Who are you to define that? ,0
"100  correct. A blu ray is a digitally compressed file already.   Streaming is not only a little more compressed, but also at an adaptive bitrate. Slower internet will see quality dip even further. Likely this was brightened a little to prevent artefacting. Blacks tend to artefact more noticably. So things a little brighter work better for streaming.",3
I'm so happy to see we are getting a bunch of backstory to Thanos ,3
Not necessarily. They could pull it off,1
Worth mentioning (if nobody else has) that BRB has already sort-of-appeared in the MCU - he's on the tower of champions on the Grandmaster's planet.,2
They should do it more often,3
I can't tell any difference besides the brightness however I wonder if they are purposefully broadcasting in low quality to keep competitiveness of retail?,1
The godzilla film universe has hundreds of connected films. The universal monsters also did.,1
Damn that sucks.,1
"And Krillin got Android 18, don t sell yourself short.",1
"you mentioned in an interview that you wanted to collect together all the behind the scenes footage of Stan Lee's cameos and make one big compilation of it, are there still plans for this?",1
Wow. How long did it take and what challenges did you face to make this masterpiece!? You look amazing btw!,1
"It definitely has potential to be one of the most emotional MCU movies. Her backstory is terribly tragic and I think it could be done in a very cinematic, Oscar bait-y way. I d say Black Widow is a guaranteed top 10, maybe top 5 MCU film. Especially with everything the cast and creatives have been saying. For me, it ll have to beat Guardians and TWS",2
Classic little humorous ending to the trailer with ant-man like we re not all having a heart attack while watching it,1
A ton of gatekeeping and opinions that pretty much only you share. Try taking a break,1
That's the Guardian's ship by the way people.,1
It's all Thor's fault. He took some food in IW and now there isn't enough for Tony.,1
"Thinking about it, I think John would ve been a good Cap. He was great in the Jack Reacher series on Amazon.",1
"Hi Kevin! Outside of Marvel, what has been your biggest success in life? On the other hand, your biggest failure?",0
"Holy crap, you look exactly her in that second pic. Well done",3
"It's definitely the specific denomination in this case, mostly. ",1
Plowed through interstellar spaceships like butter. But only made it 6 inches into Thanos  chest. Hmm.,1
"Fair enough, guess hearing the comparisons to infowars crossed some wires and made me misremember and think they portrayed it as a bit more biased than it actually was, my bad.",1
Man your edits are actually insane I don't usually comment much but I just had to!,1
Lol you stole it,2
My biggest question for Thor 4 is whether Thor and Jane will get back together. I mean it would be nice for Thor to finally get some happiness.,1
Everyone's a winner on this beautiful day,1
Please stop replying to this comment it's destroying my notifications,1
No mullet though :(,1
Meaning that Loki's show could just as likely be set in the past,2
I need A COMIC OFF THIS,1
KORGGG,1
All the opening scenes are awesome..they kind of bring the urgency into the movie,1
https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/09/28/kevin-feige-writing-out-spider-man-giving-sony-full-control/ Called it!,1
Will you be introducing the X-Men or the FF in any way shape or form during Phase 4?,1
"Peter was under-aged and wouldnt have been to be compelled to sign. Also, Tony brought him in, so anything Peter did would be Tony responsibility...whiiiich is most likely why Tony was so insistent on Peter stopping purse snatchers and car thieves. Stay off the radar in a legal sense.",1
And yet neither of them even comes close to Gone With the Wind,0
"That's an interesting hill to die on. I'd fully support that, as fucked up as it sounds. ",2
With movie-level quality. I hear the Mandalorian is pretty good.,1
Cap is so pissed.,1
He legitimately looks like Rick off of pawn stars in a cosmic wife beater. With the armor he was clearly Thanos and was intimidating and cool looking at the same time  now he just looks like a generic purple thug. ,2
"Boom, I was looking for this.",1
Happy Birthday to Tearing-me-apartLisa's mum! ,3
"I wonder what happened to cause Tony amd Nebula to split way. You think you'd stick together after that. Also, I love the suggestion that Thanos is retired judging from his hung up armor.",1
"Stop, my penis can only get so erect.",1
"Same, at first I was like I recognise him and I dont why though",1
"No, the Russo's gave an interview and outright confirmed that Cap was living in an alternate reality and had to jump back to this one for that last scene.",1
House if Marvel!!!!!,1
I like the flash of all the dead heroes right before the Marvel Studios logo dusts away,1
What media editor is that?,1
and why is Zoey Deschanel my mom?,1
But...is nice bord.,1
Is cap at a veterans meeting where they go to help cope with their lost friends? Isnt that a meeting that Sam heads at the VA in Winter Soldier? That would be a nice call back considering that both Sam and Bucky got dusted,2
"Well Thanos did say that when he was finished,  half of humanity will still be alive  so I'm assuming the snap affects half of each species",1
Can t wait for the Stan Lee cameo.,1
"Well, that depends right? Do they get the rights to any newly established spider-man related characters? Because there are a lot of new spiderlings out there in the comics",0
Yes I do. But something tells me they are trying to push for full financial control as well just so they can eventually get the rights.,1
You can see the building process on my Instagram story highlights :)  https://www.instagram.com/3dpropz/ (url),1
Not all hero s wear capes... some wear... snoo ,1
Queue Baby Groot dancing to Mr. Blue Sky,1
Can you do some justice for Galactus?,1
it's just lighter why are ppl freaking out and the resolution might have just been from bad wifi,1
"I think is a similar but simpler answer. Mutants consider themselves a group, and are seen as such by society.  While the heroes are seen more like individuals, exceptions. Visions of supremacy like Magneto's are seen as all mutants views so does their actions, like you said. But I don't think it will be an specific event that will cause mistrust. It's a social tension, just like LGBT, feminism and Black activism cause tension on conservatives.",2
Paprikash ,1
"Tony's castaway in space, Cap's mourning, Thor's anger, Banner's guilt plus Hawkeye returns as Ronin and a little levity at the end from Scott. I like it. that they didn't reveal much.",1
"That's a possibility. Or the suit could just be using Friday, which Tony used after Vision was created.",3
This trailer was everything good in the world. May can't come soon enough. ,2
"Comedy expert right here, folks.",0
If I had a dollar for everytime this was said ,3

"In the year 2019, there were 7 Marvel shows on tv. In 2018, there were 9 shows. Next year there will be 2. The year after that there will be 4. Not sure how that will cause the death of the franchise.",2

I wonder if Disney will give him a pay rise,1
Henry Cavill has expressed love and desire to return. However yaa agree Affleck has never showed much if any passion. Always seemed like he was going through the motions.,2

What surprised you the most in your 10+ years working on the mcu? And what's one thing you wanted to do but couldn't?,1
O hi ma'am!,0
This is the darkest trailer they ve ever released.,1
Why are people saying Sony is the asshole when it s marvel,1
Anyone else think Brolin's signature looks like a cow?,1
" Not Us ... I see what you did there, comrade.",1
...maybe we ll get a Planet Hulk tv show or movie...,1
well he's probably going to kill the entire Nova Corps. Except one member...,1
Amazing effort,1
This is going to be my new wallpaper :),3
"Dude, are you gonna turn into Deadpool!?",2
Well yes. But I meant the movie being part 1 of infinity war. The Willing Well suite is a 4 song suite from Good Apollo I m Burning Star IV From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness. The songs detail the Writing Writer and exploring his decision to  end  the world he has created. ,2

I love that one of my fav subs leaked,2
Okay movie way to much love for it.,1
Hi Kevin do you think we ll see any of the heroes from the marvel tv shows appear in the movies anytime in the future like Spider-Man and Daredevil teaming up to fight kingpin? And will the Disney+ shows be important to future mcu movies as we know they will deal with the aftermath of endgame.,1
"Besides the fact we have to wait for him to finish Suicide Squad 2 I am so happy he was reinstated. I think it was dumb to fire him in the first place, and I am glad he is back. Can't to see his trilogy finally be finished.",1
I'd have taken that arm. ,3
"Definitely A4 as that's been in Post for a while, maybe even in Spider-Man as that's now in post",3
This would be the perfect introduction.,2
There it is.,3
"Hi Kevin. My question is that with the Fox acquisition, which character from that banner are you most excited to bring into the MCU?",2

"Will Marvel consider financing non-superhero films in the future if such films are not in Marvel's pipeline itself, considering other, non-superhero genres should also be supported by everybody from the people/firms in the industry to movie fans?",1
....it's a nano tech helmet. You can see it has the same sort of design thing where the nano tech makes  veins  first then fills them in and you can see this helmet has the nano tech veins.,1
I still like that movie where he ended up dating Batgirl. Absolutely clueless on the name though.,1

I'm here to talk to you about the Fantastic Four initiative,2
Avengers: endgame,3
"Last shot looks like Cap, followed by Thor, Widow, Rocket, Ant-Man?, War Machine? I wanted to take a closer look to see if missed either Captain Marvel or Iron Man in that shot but Marvel is smart enough to know that every frame will be analyzed and documented two minutes after the trailer drops.",1
Wow just wow. The suit is amazing and your breathtakingly beautiful.  You can feel the charisma from that smile lol. If you could choose someone else to play captian marvel it would be you XD,0
Thanos  lawyer *loosens neck tie*  I knew I shouldn t have taken this case,3
"I understand Disney doesn't want any bad press. No doubt that's why he was fired, it's not like anyone is arguing that. But we're talking about whether or not joking about pedophilia is actually pedophilia. Your analogy doesn't work here at all. If I say  jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams  do you think that I condone 9/11? ",1
Most of MCU's music is not memorable. The Avenger's theme is one of the few exceptions but even it I find only slightly above average. If Marvel ever figures their music out and creates some themes on par with the MoS or Nolan Batman scores I'll be ecstatic. ,1

Will the focus be on bringing new perhaps less known superheroes to the big screen or maybe expand the existing universe and interconnection of characters?

"I thought Tony and Pepper's development was mostly fine, it was the subplot the Russos put in about Pepper not wanting Tony to be Iron Man which made no sense since she was ok with him being Iron Man before Civil War (Pepper never had a problem with Iron Man, she was understandably mad at his more impulsive and self-destructive decisions which wasn't due to Tony being Iron Man, it was Tony being a dumbass) and she was ok with it by Endgame so what was the point of introducing it.",1

anyone who calls for people to get fired because of things said on social media or in interviews out of context are the real problem.  im a right leaning libertarian and freedom of speech is one of the most important things to me. seeing celebrities get caught up in this faux outrage culture we have is such garbage. it lessons the impact of when people actually cross the line. we need to have a line. define  hate speech  and stick to it. throwing james gunn in with pedofiles is a travesty to free speech. ,2

A few things: Thank you for everything that you have done for the MCU!!! These are easily some of my favourite films.  What made you decide that iron man was the best character to start off the MCU? What was the hardest part in the process of developing the MCU? What has been the most enjoyable moment in the process of delivering the MCU films? What is your favourite MCU movie?,1
"Probably not a movie. If Feige had plans to use Daredevil, I don't think he would have given him away for Marvel Entertainment to use. And now they're going to have FF and the X-Men. ",1
"I agree but I think it works much much better in the movie then it does stand-alone to listen to. Those buzzing sounds and repetitive spy themes are excellent to accompany the action, but they don't just grab and hold your fascination when you have them playing by them selves. Just my opinion of course",2

"For me the defenders, ghost rider, Coulson and all of the agents were in that battle",1

This will be the mid '90s. Howard Stark is dead and Peggy is most likely retired or about to retire.,3
She only came back because of timeline fuckery though. She didn't really 'come back' as much as the other version of her came to the Avengers in Endgame.,3

100  agreed. The core Avengers went into this grand enterprise kind of unsure of how it would pan out but I think they ve really grown to understand and embrace the cultural impact these films have had.

What an absolutely moronic decision. Daredevil S3 was still as awesome. ,1
Fucking sick trailer. Really capitalized on the post snap world. Looked dark and depressing. Love it.  EDIT: Also wanted to add how seeing Cap in the rehab talking room gave me major Punisher (TV show) vibes,3

"While I do think he's been told to be quiet, I'd be extremely shocked if speaking up got him fired. I love Garfield to death, but his Spider-Man was not particularly beloved, and he could be fired without much backlash.

Fucking amateurs.  Just take a screen shot or 30 second snipit of any Marvel film. You're choice.  Now before you upload it. I want you to think of a detail to obsess over.

I'd love for them to play it off with something silly like one of them drawing a symbol or something on one of them to differentiate, just for the characters' sake in the story. 100  want some kind of dialogue where Tobey's spiderman is looked at as some kind of weirdo for having organic webs, though.",1
"It wasn't just that he didn't like working on the green screen.  Working on the movie sucked, they didn't have a script they would rewrite after shots didn't read the way they wanted.  Anyone would break if they are told to do their job every day and the requirements are constantly changing.",1

"Sure, Gunn said some pretty offensive and immature things. And yes, people should be punished. However, you could find content like this on any single modern celebrity, yet they don't get punished for it. This was completely unfair and the reason he got fired was because of a disagreement beyond those ancient tweets. It was politics, and the scum who dug into Gunns past should be ripped apart on the internet. This is ridiculous that gunn is paying for something that everyone does.",1

"True, but also realize that it could have looked like anything, being nanotech.  For all we know, his endgame suit could have been the exact same one (maybe with just some software improvements or something).

I was a fan of Aviation when it was first created at House Distillery in Portland. If I had his kind of money I would have purchased that gin too. He has a good life and wears it well.,2
"I'd like to see some breakdown of the difference between Steppenwolf and Thanos.  Thanos is real to me.  Steppenwolf just isn't.  Moreover, Davy Jones is real to me. And furthermore, I'd like to see how Disney can do Thanos but also gives the wonky Beast from Beauty and the Beast.",3
"I'll just copy what I said on twitter because I can't think of something else with this overwhelming sadness. I'm at a loss for words, my heart feels heavy and my breath is tight.

Just tell us what the fuck happened in Budapest!!!,0
You act as if it had to be written that way. They easily could have made another Iron Man in those years between 3 and Endgame. Especially since the third one grossed 1.2 billion but whatever.,1
When they are the ones unhappy not everyone agrees with them-but others are the snowflakes,1
I wish people weren't so single minded as to think that Marvel and Sony weren't **really** at least discussing the possibility of a new deal.,1

The only thing more boring than millionaires vouching for their parent company is fanboys standing up for one of the most evil monolithic monopolies having a little less control.,0
"That only works if the audience has to imagine the scenario also, and the actor is actually painting a picture of the surroundings with his acting.  If we are able to see some cartoonish, fake background and an actor who is pretending to be somewhere completely different, it just comes off wrong. ",1
"In the MCU there is no such thing as lesser great. At least as it ends in endgame. Ironman, Hulk, Dr. Strange and so on. But you know, especially hulk lacks on intro movies. The last one was great, great actor but not our last hulk as we know him. MCU did come a long way... Bravo",1
Weirdly enough I think so. Before all this went down last year James and Mark told us they had been hanging out a lot and talking about projects. It s unknown if they have ever since because of Gunn s radio silence since last year but it would be cool to see Mark Hamill in the MCU as a live action villain,1

"I'm thinking we get that thing with his daughter shooting the arrow, and they high five. Then Clint goes to grab the arrow from the target, and turns around just in time to see the last bits of his daughter floating away. If I saw that happen to my little girl I'd look exactly like he does in that shot of him standing in the rain from the first trailer.",1
"Just that you have to sacrifice to get the soul stone. If thanos has already plucked it out of oblivion, there is nothing to indicate that others couldn t use it.  Also, while I m sure the comics are different, there is no indication that the soul stone  does  anything yet. Like we have no idea what powers it has on it s own. ",3

"I wonder how old/when this concept art was made. Thor is sporting his Dark World suit with the gold accents with only Mjolnir, Spidey looks like it could be his FFH suit (or the colors are just really dark), and Thanos  armor looks more akin to the more comic-accurate version that appeared in Guardians of the Galaxy. Meanwhile,Stark looks like he s rocking the Mark 50 still (granted a lot of promotional art for Endgame did, making me believe Mark 85 was a late design).",3

MCU might be the only franchise that can do weird shit. After all they have so many well established characters and relationships they can create different type of stories that most other movies can't do since they don't have the screen time to create that sort of back story effectively.,2

Do you personally have a favorite movie in the MCU?,1
"Let s stop blaming Sony for this. This is Disney s fault completely. 5  first dollar revenue and merchandise rights? That s pretty good considering how much money that they ve made.  Disney got greedy, and offered a scam of a deal. People are so quick to jump on Sony, when Disney is the one that wanted what they couldn t have and took advantage of it. 50/50 isn t a good deal for either company, especially the Sony.",1

The difference is that James Gunn was being stupid edgy/funny to an audience. Trump was expressing how easy it was to get away with stuff with a confidant.,2
"With Amy Pascal leaving Sony, is that going to cause any disruption with the Spider-Man movies?",1
Personally I hope a single movie doesn't tie up every one of MCU Natasha's loose ends in a neat bow and some stories remain untold.,3
"So this is a bit out there, but is it possible that theres someone else helping Nebula amd Tony in the shot of them trying to fly the ship? I thought it was weirdly centred and zoomed in so could it be possible that rocket has come to help(I believe there wss a car VR experience announced called something along the lines of Rockets Rescue Ride)",1
"To understand everything probably. I doubt you won t be able to understand the movies without them. However I would give them a try even if you aren t a tv show fan.  Firstly, they are going for 6-8 episodes per series so not that long and as far as I understood they are doing for the moment only one season each. Secondly, they will have a tremendous budget so it still might have movie action. I d check The Mandalorian the new Star Wars series to get a taste of it.",1

"I think with a Black Widow movie being made it was really dumb to kill off the character. Like I understand it's a prequel, but with her still alive it'd be easier to make a sequel, or care more about this character knowing the story is still going on but we already know how it ends for her. And if the movie is really popular they'll probably wish they could use her easier in upcoming projects.",2

Its different IMO because we saw Carrie all the time. When you imagine Princess Leia you saw her face. You cant change that. Not to sound like I am belittling Stan Lee but you can watch all the Marvel movies without picturing him. You can read all the comics without picturing him. ,1
"Yes, that could make sense. The only thing for me is, Earth must be way further than Titan, so getting the message might not be easy, unless Pepper was already looking for it. But then again in Infinity War, GotG team got the SoS from the Asgardian ship, so its possible.",3

"It's not a legitimate issue if it's not true, she could have died at any time for most of the movie.  It doesn't prove the point if she was nerfed so that there was legitimate tension through the movie. Are you saying that the Thor movie was bad because Thor was nerfed, but outclasses everyone by a mile when he's powered up? Something isn't uninteresting if it has to be nerfed. Is Superman uninteresting because kryptonite exists?",1

"The thing is Team Thor was never meant to be canon, even from the start. It was just a fun video to hype up Thor and Hulk teaming up in Ragnarok  WHIH is indeed a marketing tool to promote the movies, but they did say it was canon. Like you said, a throwaway easter egg may not have as much weight as an Ant-Man cameo, but the line is still there.  To me, it only becomes non canon if Feige says WHIH is not canon, or retroactively introduces the ATCU attacks in a 2016 setting.",1

I like the one with the titties,1
I actually really liked the early seasons. I liked all the character development.  But it did pick up speed after The Dark World and Winter Soldier came out.,1

I really wished that the women characters like Valkyrie and Okoye got smaller B-plots to set up the scene, or the two women that actually got good minor plots (Nebula and Widow) used that scene as a culmination to their character arcs.",1

I still don't understand why he does the voice.  He's a huge star who is surely pulling down way more money than a traditional voice actor would.  Someone like  Nolan North (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636046/?ref =ttfc fc cl t4) would have done just as well and I'm sure he would have been cheaper.

The only financial deal that makes sense is one that makes Sony more money than they would on their own. All of the Sony Spider-Man/Venom movies have made over  800 million for them.  Homecoming made  880 million and Far From Home made 1.1 billion.   Take 5  of that money away under their old deal and all the sudden that is pretty close to the money they make on their own.,2
I'm inclined to agree. And I'm certain it'd be a long shot but it would be a nice thank you to longtime AoS fans.,0

Except for 2018 when she looked like blonde Benadeyl Cucumberbatch in Infinity War.,3

Yes that Disney owns,1

"*we're in the endgame now.*   It was fairly obvious what it was potentially going to be. Great title, fits the movie",0
Because you cast this early. They have to film next year and the year after. Many actors were cast for roles 2-3 years early. Brie Larson was cast well over a year before she even filmed anything. Also 2021 is stuffed.,2
Probably 1x1=0,2
"I don't think keeping the timeline same would be too much of a priority. Cap's main objective was to return the stones to their respective timelines.

Doctor Strange horror movie with Scarlet Witch costarring? Shit is gonna get as weird as it can,1
"I'd argue against it, because there are moments in season one that are too important to later seasons or that go into too much detail about the characters to skip. Episodes 14 and 17 are especially important, too. Honestly, it's probably just the first 10 episodes where they try to find their feet where the show is just eh, and then it ramps up from there and reaches a crescendo in episode 17 (and the season is great from thereon).",1
"To me, Wanda is a very powerful but unstable character. I doubt  regular  Wanda could defeat Thanos. But in the right  emotion , she could hold off 5-infinity-stone-powered Thanos.

"Hi King Kevin, Can we expect any symbiote storyline regarding Spider-Man or any other MCU character ? Is Sony willing to cooperate or are you  (Marvel Studios or you) not willing to involve Sony's Venom into the MCU ? THANKS for everything you've done for us",1

"Nope, that s staying blue ",1
They were such a good idea. I'd buy the DVD or blu Ray or whatever if those were included,1
is this true : )),1
what was the soundtrack used in this?,1
Hawkeye and black widow did have a spaceship. What movie were you watching?,1
That would be incredible.,1
FUCK YEAH.,1
All reposts are made up.,3
"Ha, that's awesome!",1
Maybe an amusing space montage set to the tune  raindrops keep fallin' on my head ?,1
Same way for me. Pixar and Marvel films made me appreciate the credits. Me and my ex would always point out interesting names and such. I wish MCU films would have Production Babies like PIXAR and Disney films do -- always my favorite part and I never skip ahead.,3
 This guy agrees (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91JbpVMzPrL. RI .jpg).,1
Just missing one thing... Sony,0
"My man, good on him!",1
"All of them, watch it in release order",1
"If it's about looks mostly then why didn't you mention that in the post?  Furthermore, I think you might be full of shit. Dickinson isn't a movie, it's a TV show.  Also Hailee looks like Kate. Like. There is a resemblance. I think you might just be projecting.",2

Thank you! Cool answer,1
Interesting take.,0
"Reading through this thread is making me lose a lot of faith in reddit. I understand being upset and thinking that he should be forgiven for his actions, but petitioning to get him back and saying it's the most horrible thing ever that he got fired? Give me a break... His tweets got found because he was doing the exact thing that you all are criticizing the alt-right for doing",1

How are you doing today? Hope you're feeling well.,1
Definitely my favorite theme in the whole MCU. ,2
What's sad is Marvel would get it right.,3
That Drax one is sick!  Good work dude/dudette!,2
So what? They don't care about the tweets they care about the public outcry.,1
I liked Tony s and Steve s closure. Too bad I didn t like the movie much.,1
Who likes to watch dark movies like that. Why I hated ninja assassin could see what was going on.,3
"Yep, are we going to draw the line at directing movies, or are we going to hold the president accountable for what HE said and NEVER apologized for?",2
"Hey there Mr. President! Thanks for doing this. x200B Did you anticipate that people who had never seen a Marvel movie, or maybe only seen a few, would flock to Infinity War and Endgame the way that they did? And did this affect your marketing strategy at all?",1
FUCK IT! WE'LL DO IT LIVE! ,2
"But if it costed 300 million to revenue 800 million, profit would be 500 million. 167  ROI. If they went 50/50 on the budget, Sony only has to fork out 150 million to revenue 500 million, profit would be 350 million. 233  ROI.",1
He will never sign on to be in a new franchise.  Dude wanna have fun doing weird movies.  Let him be.,3
I'm gonna give this guy the benefit of the doubt and believe he is telling the truth. But i find it so funny that everyone readily believes he's being honest. You know how easy it is to make up a story and just play it out on reddit? Can you tell me with a straight face that every single post on the front page is 100  honest? ,1
"I have my suspicions that Feige was a major player behind the scenes. Glad that Gunn is back, after what Karen Gillan said I had lost hope that he would return.",2
I know your department is movies but do you think there's ANY possibility of a Marvel fighting game being made by a Company like NetherRealm Studios? Ed Boon already said he'd love to try to make a Marvel Fighting Game.,1

why did you guys choose to go with time travel for avengers endgame?,1
"wow, just wow. I couldn't be happier about this. very surprised with disney",1
"Its on the list. But there s a lot of movies, you know?",3
Hi Kevin!  Much like everyone else here love how the MCU has progressed over the years so thank you for that! Was there ever a point in the 11 years of the MCU where you were worried if audiences were going to keep up with everything?,1
"Unless your /s Still worth it for me, dotn have 4k nor do I have blu-ray so watching clone wars I'd have to buy a physical discs which are shit quality on DVD and pretty pricey. No where I know I can watch Clone Wars in EU cause we never had it on Netflix Also mandalorian",2

Will actors that are leaving the MCU with Infinity War and Endgame eventually come back?  How far did you think the MCU would go when you released Iron Man?  Do you think Deadpool is going to be introduced in the MCU in the near future?,1
"I like how only Gamora, Nick Fury, and Hawkeye are the only ones that are looking directly at the audience",1

"I know its just a video game but after playing the Witcher 2-3 (dont have PC so i just had to watch stuff on 1) I started looking at things people do.

I almost screamed in public when I first saw this trailer. If anybody was looking at me watching this they must've thought I was crazy.,1
Where? I don't remember any politics in it.,3

They gotta make Jacob Batalon a legit hero somehow..  Guy in Chair  is already taken by Prof X. So .. he'd need to be somebody else. Rhino? maybe?,1
"Not his fault tho, is it? This quote isn't even recent. It just surfaced because his birthday was yesterday.",1
I think Homecoming Civil War IW Endgame and FFH were part of the same original deal I think they will use the third movie  and one more appearenfe to tie his story together aka IM 3 and if they manage to get more movies his story will continue but if not then his story won't be left open,1

The point is that Natasha doesn t need to be replaced by Yelena because it s literally just rampant sexism to do so.,0
"Hmm... a country like Germany pushing a racist film from the late 30's as having made an insurmountable total? Why Oh Why would they do that. GWTW didn't even make  200 million, much less a billion, much less  3.7 billion or  6.7 billion. Its just fake numbers.",0
" Daredevil is a great character, but She-Hulk is literally the better lawyer, canonically.",3

"I thought the girl power team-up in Infinity War was better.  More subtle. But then I thought, if this new scene is Marvel's way of saying  fuck you  to the 41+ (and counting) trolls in this comment section who are taking any opportunity to hate on Brie Larson?  Then maybe that's not so bad.",1

>There were so many holes I couldn t see everything Title of your sextape,2
The inclusion of the mutants in the MCU doesn t really make sense from a Deadpool standpoint. They showed a bunch of the Fox mutants in a small room behind Wayde in one scene. And those mutants are tied in with a different version of juggernaut.,2
"A one minute video with countless hours behind it, I assume. Awesome job!!",1
"Well we already see she made a bulls-eye. Maybe she gets a robin hood, and then dusts. ",1
"Yes, definitely proved his worth. My sister hadn t seen Antman and the Wasp so the night before she saw Endgame I told her she needed to watch it not just because of quantum realm stuff but to see Scott as a character. Makes his role in Endgame much more rewarding.",1

"By the time we get Hawkeye we re IN the next phase of the MCU. Don t need any setup. Unless you mean setting up Phase 5, but I think Hawkeye should be about closure for Hawkeye, not setting up the future (other than Kate Bishop, but you can do her and have flashbacks).",3
I have those shoes.,1
10 years in the making... And it looks like it will be worth the wait!,1
Another reason is to tighten up the story or to meet a proposed running time.,1

How many people have you called a Nazi today?,1
"Well, one of those can't happen legally. And the other makes no sense. They aren't going to promote the TV line in the movies. It's most likely a FFH teaser",1

"That's the thing about powers though. There's no hard reason why they have to be  earned , though I agree it tends to feel more satisfying when they are.",2
How come there weren t any MCU TV series characters called to fight Thanos in Endgame?,1
Well. Titans are cousins of the externals so they are inherently powerful. And then I m pretty sure Thanos is as peak physical capability.,2

Behind Chris Hemsworth and Anthony Russo,1
I don't think it should be assumed that you're aware of the events of AoS just because you're here. But it should definitely be assumed by you that those events could be spoiled in a place like this. Like seriously? Who comes into a clear EG spoiler thread and complains about AoS spoilers?,2
Lol. Scott existing = 100  chance of beating thanos.,1
"They d have to add that pretty far into production since they re not legally allowed to even write material for Daredevil in the MCU until the end of November 2020. But then again, they fast-tracked Spider-Man and Tom Holland into the MCU pretty quickly after the initial deal with Sony was made, so it s possible.",1

Well the way one person in the chain described it was a film about how humanity grapples with losing half of its population in an instant. Probably not ever gonna be getting Best Picture or Writing noms. But it'd definitely be fair game for acting if the performance was top notch. Let's not forget that Heath Ledger did win for the Dark Knight. Johnny Depp was nominated for Curse of the Black Pearl. It's not unprecedented.,1

That wouldn t work for Sony. If they sell their pictures department the rights automatically revert back to Marvel. Sony can t sell Spider-Man to a third party. And if they just sit on the rights they will lose them if they don t make a movie in a timely manner.,2

That is a very good idea and it makes a lot of sense since in the MCU shield has already been seen using alien technology to create weapons (the destroyer turned into coulson's weapon in avengers 1) so I can see Bolivar Trask use his influences with the government to collect the remains of a Kree sentry (possibly destroyed by Carol) and reverse engineer and recreate it with its own modifications and its artificial intelligence could be the prototype of the Master Mold,1

This way, he get's to make amends for his failure and, simultaneously, gets nerfed for the battle with Thanos (because in Infinity War he nearly killed Thanos with the full gauntlet, so he was pretty OP). At the same time, this allows Hulk to be at full strength to confront Thanos later on, in the final battle, giving him the rematch he deserved.",2

Which leads me to the question of who were past non-mainstream actors/actresses who were really good that got the boost from Marvel?

Were Chadwick Boseman or Anthony Mackie known to be great actors before their roles?,2

Doom is no doubt going to be a large character.",2
That scene where Fury writes Avengers over protectors was shown uncut here. Too bad it was not present in any home releases.

The comments there mention a few extra -- Whiplash cuts him and almost shuts him down with electricity, so he makes a suit that can absorb and return Thor's lightning.

"Kang the Conqueror, especially if time travel is involved in Endgame it just makes sense. I know people keep saying Doom, but Kang is a major Avengers bad guy with big (familial) ties to the Fantastic Four, versus Doom who is primarily defined by his relationship with the FF. In my opinion he would be a much better villain to help redefine the Avengers lineup and bring in the FF. ",1
I believe when Cooper signed on to play Rocket he cut a deal that opted him out of doing press for the movie. There s only one interview I remember seeing him talk about it which was on the BBC. Also he records all his lines after the rest of the movies been filmed so is almost never with the other cast. I m pretty sure the first time he met the others was at the premiere or sometime close to it. I think he likes the role just not all the hoops to jump through.,3

Marvel wasn't around when they were discussing the plan so she didn't know she needed a suit. she came to the battle midway through so she just assumed the goal was to get the gauntlet to the van with no idea what would happen if she made it there. So the writers had Thanos destroy the van avoiding the calamity that would ensue if she entered the quantum realm without a suitor GPS tracker. IMO.,1

Yeah I don't think people realize how big a change the guardians thing is. They would have completed filming on it now and it would likely have been released in May 2020. Last summer when the Gunn thing blew up they dismissed all the people who were about to start building sets for a may 2019 film start,3
"Those would mean the same thing if their behavior was the same. Gunn never showed signs of actual pedophilia, while Trump still continues to make unappropriate comments on women and has a history of sexual assault allegations.  Situations with Trump and Gunn are very different.",2

Even his  Gimme a little juice, FRIDAY  from Infinity War was the result of his inability to get to Rhodey fast enough in Civil War.",3

And let us not forget that he needed to know whether he was still worthy in all his misery and that he actually got the relief that his failure doesn t make him unworthy.

"Nor was End Game, we lost heroes in that too",1
"Sony is pinning an awful lot of hope on Venom. If you do the math, even if there's already a 50/50 split for Homecoming and Far From Home, Sony would still make more money from those films than ASM and ASM 2. And even though Spider-Verse was a great film, it didn't make nearly as much money as the live action films.",1
I think they filmed most of his last few cameos at the same time in 2016 I remember James Gunn directed a bunch of them. Captain Marvel was probably his last time on set since that was the most recently filmed before he passed.,1

Honestly I m hoping that it s a anthology series telling different scenarios like what if Thanos won or what if Killmonger was the leader of Wakanda. Hell what if Thor went for the head the first time around.,3
Everyone's hair tbh. ,1
He really really does,3
She did a few weeks of live theater as the deadbeat dad in  Bambi: The Musical. ,3
I'm fucking crying at work,1
"Yes, the answer to those questions is a resounding yes. > I've got a really good black person joke for ya  - says a racist. > What do you call a women who isn't in the kitchen?  - says a sexist. > I like it when little boys touch me in my silly place  - says a pedophile.",2
that makes me so much more sadder.,1
Did you notice the snap that still took out half of all life in the universe?,0
Damn it Barry.,3
If Disney/Marvel is done with him then DC has a massive opportunity here. They could hire him and their movies would be much better for it. ,0
 Don't do anything I would do... and definitely don't do anything I wouldn't do. There's a little gray area in there and that's where you operate.  -Tony Stark,3
You re about 5 years too early. Steven Strange is a couple blocks that way performing surgery at the moment  - I think that s what she said,3
It s been stated that Marvel TV has to get permission from Marvel Studios to use characters.,2
Well the latest season of Shield is pretending that the snap never happened,0
Really good for being fan made.,1
Emblematic af,1
And just like that you've convinced me Thanos was right to want to destroy the entire universe.,2
What is it that you dont like?,2
"Im not saying boycott. But reinstate him or for me as a loyal fan who spends money on everything marvelstudios puts out this can be the first big dent in your reputation. James Gunn is James Gunn, you knew that , now let him make magic for us",3
Since Spider-Man is distributed by Sony and Hulk distributed by Universal they likely won't appear on D+,1
"i mean it's an MCU production so it's not terrible, it meets the basic standards but it was definitely a bit of a damp squib it's probably representative of the quality we can expect after Endgame",1
Pepper?,1
you fool you fell victim to one of the classic blunders,0
"Hi Kev, you are an absolute legend mate! Thank you for everything you have done for us. We love you 3000. I have just one question: What made you decide to choose Iron Man as the character to kickstart the MCU?",1
It s 100  Stormbreaker. He s leaning on it when it cuts back to him.,1
Where was Rocket? And Rhodey? We saw everyone else except them I think,1
Endgame seems like a fake title,1
Fake Russian  hacking  sounds perfectly reasonable.  /s,1
"Yeah, mindless fanboyism on this sub is rampant.",1
"It's not sealed yet, but both parties walked away.. Some people claim that Disney leaked the converstations to create a public outrage and force Sony to compromise on their terms. And it's very plausible all things considered. To be honest after the panic kind of left me, it became clear that Sony would be a fool to not try to come to some sort of deal, seeing as they have much more to lose if they walked. I guess we'll have to wait and see and get the pitch forks ready.",1
"It would be interesting to see how Villeneuve handles Dune first. Akira fans probably definitely don't want a Hollywood superhero-style action movie. Akira is pretty serious, dark, even savage.",2
"Can we expect to see future Stan Lee cameos, except instead of him being in a scene there would be a picture of him or a statue in the background or something?",1
I doubt it's his first scene in movie. He probably learned that some shit went down when he couldn't fidn his family or saw so many people missing. And IW had comedic scenes.  ,1
I'm guessing something about his deteriorating sight. I know he mentioned before he couldn't read comics anymore.,1
I bet she's regretting that now,3
Disney:  Its rewind time .,1
"Yep. 3 seasons, less than 30 episodes. Probably the best acted show I ve ever seen.",2
This movie better be 4 hours!!!!,1
Nebula is Tony s new box of scraps confirmed,3
I don't think that. He seems like an incredibly likable person who takes his religion seriously. I don't have a problem with him as he seems to do everything he can to distance himself from the disagreeable viewpoints of his associated religion.,0
"Yeah, I had to sign one for a game I got to play early. I can t even talk about it after the game has come out without breaking my NDA.",1
Thanks you asshole now I'm crying,1
Or Valkyrie...,3
AWESOME!!!,1
She messed up on captain marvel,1
"Guys, this makes me happy. :)",1
She s playing Thena.,2
"Yeah, I've done the full watch through already",1
Shang chi was the one that blew my mind berries. Just be like old school enter the dragon.,3
oh mate,1
Not if I watch End Game again it's not. You stop.,1
It gives me hope that whoever ends up directing the movie won't be able to strongarm script changes. The cast is likely to fight tooth and nail to keep the script how Gunn wanted it.,1
"Kree blood was used to revive Colson and they created the Inhumans through Genetic manipulation. It's not farfetched to assume that when they create a supersoldier, he's immortal. Also Ronan is in her squad and doesn't look any different than in GotG, so presumably he doesn't age as well. ",1
What's your favourite big comic boom event and your favourite small intimate one character event?,1
Welcome Ronin. So hawkeye's family is gone too. He lost more than the others. ,1
What if that movie is Doctor Strange 2 and Spider-Man travels to the Venomverse to escape after the reveal of his identity and Spider-Man 3 takes place there. Doctor Strange DOES come out 2 months before Spider-Man.,1
The ancient one was a precognitive empath. She knew the future up until the point of her death so she knew she didn't have to get involved.   I'm not sure why there's resistance to linking the mutant gene to an MCU related event. The MCU has adjusted many different origins from The hulk to Captain Marvel. the X-Men aren't going to be any different,1
Up there with broken arm dude who banged his mom.  Youre a tough mofo alexander. Enjoy the film. Say hi to Chris for me please,3
Biggest regret in the MCU?,1
what was the biggest change the studio made in the final cuts of any of the films that you or the directors were forced to abide that didnt sit well with the writers or staff?,1
Are the x-men going to be joining the mcu because of Disney buying Warner brothers?,1
That seems obscenely expensive when you put it like that. But am sure they prioritize much of the funds into the cgi and stunt work.,1
Looks more like Thanos about to BUST,2
"I mean, Spider-Man has openly had fights where he fought with Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Hulk, and at this point what happens at the end of Endgame is probably widely known so he's probably an international celeb. It's not like he's Daredevil",2
Hello Mr. Feige - thank you for taking the time out of your day to do this! Who would you say is your favourite avenger? Past or present :),1
Heimdall running off with the sword is Sony taking Spider Man back then right?,1
I hope we get a moment like this https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bec579604f0fb13d80f1cbb1d164030e,1

Best movie ever! I love women!  metoo,0
 *curtseys * Thank you. This one lives to serve.,1
"Basically he forgot about the gauntlet (the source of his power) when he was turning into God, which gave Nebula the opportunity to grab it. The writers justified such a huge oversight as Thanos subconsciously sabotaging himself because he knows he's not worthy.",2
He vanted his burd!,3
"I imagine the timelines he got snapped in and was later brought back would just have gaps in the five years he was gone, so he couldn't see what the Avengers were doing during those five years but knew they managed to bring everyone back.",1
"I like to see him as a combo of Ironman, Black Panther   Dr Strange.",1
"I believe this particular tweet is one of the tweets he  retweeted,  making it look like his friend said it.  Gunn was making it look like his friend said this to mess with him  Gunn was not posting this as something he was saying about himself.  There were several tweets like this that people missed that aspect of the context. See this (really well-done) reddit thread on the subject: https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/92bgiu/james gunn did not make 10000 jokes about rape/",1
"Will you be doing any more press conferences where you lay out the movies to come, sort of like how you did laying out phase 3 for us?  Those events create so much hype for what is to come and it is fun to see what you guys are working on.",1
"I think that s something the movie did amazingly. I knew the heroes  had  to win, but for just a split second I considered that Thanos might actually snap again.",3
"I mean, a supersoldier reinforced with vibranium could probably require much more strength than Thanos anticipated. ",1
"FUCKING BRILLIANT. x200B They didn't show much, but at the same time just enough to tease us and get us hyped. Glad it confirmed some popular fan theories about Ronin and the Quantum Realm.",1
THE ZITS ARE HERE!,2
Jakes suit is sick!!,1
"Hey you guys? This video... everything that can be said about the MCU has now been said.  I think... we re done. We can shut the sub down. We did it. Good job everybody, shut down your computer shut down the sub.",1
Imagine being so emotionally invested in some capeshit movie that you gild the post.,0
Glorious casting idea haha,1
So... you don t want a  Fith thsandwich? (url),1
If she were gone she probably wouldn t show up as  missing . Scott and Peter are there because they disappeared before the snap. If she simply got dusted they would know she s dead and not just missing.,1
OOOOOO MMMYYYYYY FFFIUUUCCCKKKKIIINNGGG GOOOOODDDD!!!!!! ,1
Hello mr feige can you make me an actor please,1
"Sad to see him go, but he lived a full, happy life.  ",1

"Footballers get transferred all the time, even when they have years left on their contract. All it takes is for the current contract to have been written on the correct terms, and the new  owner  to pay the previous  owner  for the privilege. I doubt his contract with Sony was written in such a way, but I d say it s worth Disney s lawyers taking a look at it.",1
I'd love to see it.  My concern is how do you write this movie and not have it be contrived 'only the women can help this time'?,1
You didn't ask for the rocket launcher? ,1
Your not suppose to take this stuff home with you once the filming is done!,1

"Look at Mr. Porn Star here, lasting a whole 5 seconds!",2

Basically Thanos goes on to win and kill most of the universe. Adam Warlock (Basically Marvel Jesus) points out that he's all alone and Thanos brings everyone back.,3

"I'm not super into star wars but isn't any kind of sexual anything completely void for 99  of characters? Chewbacca could be gay for all anyone knows. Besides they're fiction characters, deside he's gay and he's gay, or bi, or trans. I've seen no evidence he wasn't born female and identifies as male. Point is, in most films, most characters sexuality isn't touched upon every guy who isn't shown as specifically straight could just as likely be gay as straight and they could all be bi.",1
Who do you think would make for a good Mister Negative in the MCU? Maybe Stephen Oyoung himself? I'd like to see the character in Spider-Man 3.,1
Hawkeye ready to bust some thanos ass.  ,1
"Machines need fuel too. Otherwise, we'd have the answer to unlimited energy in the MCU.",3
My first impression of the  team uniforms /spacesuits/whatever is that they give off a very *Mass Effect* N7 vibe with different colors.  I'm really digging them.,1
So that's a 6-7 week gap after Captain Marvel. Just long enough for CM to tail off.,1
"I hope you were feeling good, though.",3
"Everyone said this, including myself, it s interesting",3
I just really wish we could have seen Agent May in Captain Marvel the way we got Jarvis in Endgame. Something quick that acknowledges the character's presence in the universe without being so big it's distracting from the movie,3
I hope he can see Captain Marvel too! Glad this will happen for him.,1
Wow that's a great way to look at it.,1
Hawkeye just standing there like that isn't the coolest shit he has ever seen.,1
I reckon so.,3

"It's a little of both - dudes with 8-packs and rippling muscles work out specifically to look a certain way, not for optimal strength training.

"He ain't some big flashy movie star like the Rock, He is more like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Dave Bautista is a good actor, a good guy and one hell of a *f * *king* gangster.",1

" When I'm done half of humanity will still exist ... So in other words, everyone that went to see Infinity Wars will still survive.",1
But it takes 15 seconds to ask the question and get a short summary. Don t waste those precious calories typing.,1
"Damn, I think back on that show as gratuitous blood and tits, but it could deliver a character arc when it wanted to.  That show was a stepping stone for some great actors (Antony Starr, Odette Annable, Tom Pelphrey), and there are a bunch more I'd love to see more from (Ulrich Thomsen, Matt Servito, Hoon Lee...)",1
But the existence of that movie improved the Deadpool movie.,1

"Another REALM !!,,,,, he is not monitoring this universe... how can people not understand.... And in Doctor Strange movie.. they literally said there are multi verses..",3
Guardians was before AOU. I kinda felt like Feige managed to sneak winter soldier and gotg under perlmutters nose in phase 2 because they were not as high profile as some of the other projects. Then Feige used their success as leverage to get Disney to hand him the keys for phase 3 ,1
"Im a notoriously slow reader but was determined to really take in the books. I remember when I was reading them I sat with another book in the series to flip through maps and lineages while reading, just so I could properly understand everything. It was a monumental task for sure. ",1

Ok so what I really can't understand is why Tony calls Pepper  Miss Potts . This is something he would say back when she was his secretary. I may just be overthinking this but what if he's sending this back into the past somehow?,1
You know you can t eat dumbbells. ,3
"Here's what everyone is assuming....Thor is in GotG Vol 3. I mean, yea, it's joked about at the end of Endgame and heavily implied he'll join the team. But for all we know, he just gets a lift off them from Earth to wherever the hell he is going and that's it.",3

Disregard this comment if you aren't attempting to make fun of my superior hardware.

"I would think context and character would be the difference. Looking at the differences Roseanne's tweet was a recent one, both in general and relative to her controversy. James's was 10 years prior. That would say that Roseanne's was more on line with her current character. Even more important was that James apologised when he was confronted. Roseanne doubled down and reinforced the tasteless joke.  For the record, I don't think either was enough that they should have been fired for it.",1
I didn't think it was fine :(,2
Title was spoiled when I looked up Avengers trailer on YouTube and those stupid fucking repost trailer channels had posted it with the title in the name of the video.,1

I'm sure there'll be plenty of humanized villains between now and a possible Galactus event. It's not like we came out of the gate with Thanos. I think Marvel's too smart to jump straight to another reality shattering big bad event.,3
 Well... Here I am...  ,1
"I totally get not being down with Scientology. From what I've heard about them, I'm definitely with you. But the only way to avoid supporting Michael Pena is to not see any of his movies.

"Should make a  Hidden Detail  post about that, man /s",3
How they get used is not worked out. Sony wanted to make Venom part of the MCU but Feige rightfully didn t want someone else coming in and messing with his world. So then Sony just made Venom it s own property without Spider-Man. Also now Sony is saving the good villains for their own movies and won t let the MCU use them. They didn t work that out from the start.,0

"As I ve come to understand, they ve already filmed his cameos for several films to come. Now that he s passed on, I feel conflicted about having those cameos in those upcoming films. On one hand, you could argue having him there is paying respect to the man responsible for it all. On the other, shouldn t the films themselves be enough if they stay true to the vision he had? To respect what he created, what he gave us by bringing that vision to life? I m just very unsure of how to feel about this.",1

"Hi Kevin, I ve got two questions, but I ll be more than happy if you only answer one. 1. What character or set of characters are you most disappointed about not being able to include in the universe yet, either due to rights issues or not being able to fit them into the overarching plans. 2. If you had been given the chance to build the DC cinematic universe before Man of Steel was made, how would you have gone about it?",1

"I think it's definitely heavily acted, most of her other work that I've seen has had a relatively consistent lower tone without much rasp. I love Larson as an actor, but am not sure how I feel about the vocal delivery in the trailer.

Favorite Marvel movie? And I do not mean MCU/Marvel Studios. Anything using Marvel characters is fair game. You gain the power of total persuasion of everybody.

"GOTG2 is in the top five for me, personally. It s way better than the first one, in my opinion. The cinematography is better, it s more colorful, they take bigger risks. GOTG2 is one of the only Marvel movies to make me cry. The Ravager ship escape scene with Yondu, Rocket, and Baby Groot gives me chills every time. It s one of my favorite scenes in the entire MCU. I ve never understood the hate for the film either, I think it s much better than its predecessor.",1

Is it really foreshadowing if she's just straight calling it? There is no allusion. ,1
I'm gonna say that's debatable. You can still be in love with someone while moving on. It happens all the time. At the same time though I agree that it's likely that plot thread wont come back up. Especially if this is actually Cap's last rodeo.,1
You can also analyze it s original box office run to remove those extra runnings down the road though.,1

Well this is a shitty cake day surprise. ,1
"Hi Kevin, massive fan of your work. Now that you have access to the old Fox properties, there are a lot of people excited about a good Fantastic 4 movie. Despite some  best efforts  the movies have never been great. Do you think that the Marvel way can make the movie fans want? What is your process of making this happen?",1
"Is that it? I'm really impulsive and bad with money but if I was lottery rich and saw this for sale I would easily go up to  100,000 without questioning my self, wife would kill me after though..",1
And it explains why she's not at full power in A4 so she doesn't just completely take down Thanos,2
Thor and Captain Misdirect.,2
It's a hollow victory,0

"Given the whole multiverse thing the MCU is gonna expand on, it dosent necessarily even need to be in the prime timeline but some other reality which connects to the main one. The timeline is quite saturated already and they dont wanna contradict anything but from what I remember, not much happened in the 60s in the main MCU. Then again, I also like the Sokovia = Latveria theory so who knows how its gonna go.",3
"When you say  right next to,  do you mean ... affixed in some way ",2
More like the opposite. Shuri is  smug and annoying  the same way Tony or Strange are - in a loveble way. Valkyrie is a painfully cliche utterly unfunny character whos  badassness  amounts  being a drunkurd hobbo is cool ..,1
Until DC gets their shit together I doubt Marvel would risk it.,3
"Gonna be spooky and teary eyed, seeing his cameo in Avengers IW 2.. Excelsior forever",1

Well thats good because at least Marvel studios will make one more mcu spidey film in 2021 before sony will make their own Spiderman film universe without marvel studios and Disneys involvement that unless if venom 2 and Morbius bombed at the box office.,0
With the particles Cap stole from Hank Pym in 1970. He probably stole plenty more than he and Tony needed.,1

That's America's finger,3
 SPOILER ALERT!!!,1
This just makes me wish Heimdall was still alive :(,1
Ruffalo isn't the problem. The Russo's don't really understand the character.  Only thing they really did right was sweep Brutasha under the rug a bit.,3
"I'm basing it off a combination of the infinity war comic, the new avengers line up and possibly the secret invasion which they are sort of setting up, and box office draw of certain actors or characters. I think I'll be pretty accurate. Can't wait for both films tbh.",1
"Probably strong armed by Disney, notice how he singles out Sony despite the fact that Disney is in the wrong here. Man doesn't bite the hands that feeds him, that's fine.",1
"How does it feel being in charge of so many characters, storylines, etc. And make sure all works?",1
Why didn't he have it in Infinity War?,1
"All I'm saying is that Gunn deserved it and the left was responsible for it as they created the situation,  so stop the victimization. That last sentence directed at the people who are claiming it all was not fair.",0

All shit their pants in the presence of Galactus. Except Doom. Doom throbs at the opportunity.,1
It s only a matter of time until one of these terminal patients seeing movies early is an actual asshole who just happens to be dying and spoils the shit out of the movie for everyone. ,1
It would need 10 rereleases for that,3

I need to know this  ,1
"The casting throughout the MCU is absolutely astonishingly well done. I literally can't think of a single bad note across the entirety of the films OTHER than the one movie she didn't work on. and some of the choices were so inspired (particularly Downy Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, and Johansson) that I can hardly imagine anyone else playing the role. She deserves a TON of recognition for her work on this series.",3
just like in titanfall 2,3
"I imagine that was either to throw people off or they had a reshoot after feeling something didn't quite click with the scene. I'll be honest, Odin's role seemed... well, more or less a throwaway thing to get him out of the way. It might be he was never actually originally *in* the film, he'd already died. Doctor Strange told Thor that, they move off home, get ambushed by Hela. No idea, probably deeply wrong, but that's just my off the cuff idea as to why there's a difference.",1
"I mean there s spoilers rules, and there s spoiler courtesy. The courteous way of doing it would be to just mention that you re going to talk about something that happens in the last 50 pages of the entire series.  EDIT: entire series *which this sub is not about*",0
"I look at it like a really cool movie to see in 3d, but the story and everything else about it was meh. I have no interest in seeing a sequel in the theater. But the original was a cool experience for the time.",1

I think he meant it in a good way. You re a cool guy and glad you have a lot still left in you. Keep that coolness and positive attitude in adulthood as much as you can!,2
"Tomorrow, we can expect 1000 websites with the magnificent title:  What you missed from the trailer, you stupid people ",1
"Thanks to Stan Lee I had a childhood rich in Spider-man   X-Men comics, which gave an aspie a reason to keep fighting the good fight despite being misunderstood by others, and showed her that being born different can give someone the power to help in ways that others may not have been able to. Rest in Peace, and Excelsior!",1
That image of Cap crying :(,1
Maybe it's the other... head. Ant Man crawls into Thanos's dick hole confirmed! ,1

That crop s not ripe yet. ,1
"Hi Super Kev, Any thoughts on an MCU based Role Playing Game where you create a hero and incorporate them into an Infinty War sized universe? I'd love a game where a character I made would join the MCU and interact with the heroes we know and love. If there were different action and dialogue choices that impacted how certain avengers felt towards your character it'd be so fun to play over and over again.",1
Wow. Utter stupidity.,3

I'm honestly fine with ot now. I've come to terms with AOS not being included. Considering it's the best marvel show(to me) and the best superhero show to have been on. The storylines are so much more interesting and fleshed out than other shows.,1
I feel like a family member just passed. RIP Stan,3
alls I'm saying is that it seems that the guardians have had space age technology for millennia already and it even seems to older it dates back the more advanced it is (celestials) . I doubt stark would be able to  upgrade  her. Their technology might upgrade his suit however,2

"Hey Kevin, big fan of Marvel and everything you ve helped create. My question is what hero are you most excited to bring to the big screen next? Someone that hasn t had much light shown on her/her. Kind of like what you guys did with the Guardians and what you are doing with the Externals.",1
"I was keeping an eye out for the trailer. I looked over and saw an inspirational poster and a stadium, so I assumed it was some kind of  What it means to be an athlete  type of commercial. Nope.",2
"Damn... No I know a lot of people will enjoy this and love ragnarok but it's too much of a comedy movie for me.   I really hope maybe it is a script problem. More than the director but not everything has to be funny.  Thor isn't a comedy character like ant man, Spiderman, and guardians and they kind of nailed him in the original movie.   The thing is Thor is more drax than starlord.   You can make it a funny movie but he's kind of the straight man in the humor.",2

"I want an answer to this too although I'm more inclined to buy Markus and McFeely's answer, since they wrote the story and have been threading this ending in since Winter Soldier. It makes zero sense to have him in an alternate timeline considering how his return was depicted, and they were always careful not to depict her husband in any way. I'm confident it was always him.",1
at would actually be a better lyric.,0
They have conclusions. They didn't end on cliffhangers.,0
Side project huh,1
Thank you for giving me a reason to stay alive.,1
Is Captain America s age a plot hole and is it possible that Cap lived extremely long until time travel was invented by someone else and that s why he s so old? Was Thors new  physique  to make him look Norse? Will you add the X-men to the MCU using Spider-Man Far From Home and the Snap? That s it  Thanks Kevin !,1

do marvel have spider man back??,1
I think he's just upset that he hasn't yet been given his real bird costume with red spandex,3
I guess. I also feel like they're just releasing too many movies and eventually it's gonna bite them in the ass when quality dips due to cgi not getting done in time or whatever it ends up being. We've already seen glimpses of this with the ending of BP and Bruce Banners head in the Hulkbuster in infinity war (just off the top of my head),1

"He did also manage to convey an inner darkness as well though.  Like during the first Avengers where Black Widow tracks him down, and the scene between them is played with so much unease.  There's an implicit understanding between both of them that if the Hulk were to come out, she'd be squashed like a fruit.  He knows he has the upper hand, and plays with it a bit.",3

"It's a stretch to call Captain America a prequel. It certainly doesn't function as one the way a Black Widow prequel would, because we'd never seen Cap before. Same with Captain Marvel, but at least with that one you learned a lot about the founding of the Avengers initiative and Fury's backstory. Black Widow has appeared in like six movies now, do the comparison doesn't really hold weight.",2

How freakin  big is Ant-Man here? In Ant-Man   the Wasp he tells Lawrence Fishburne that his record is 65 feet. He looks about double that here.,2
I still feel like that's a cop out. Thor had a big triumphant moment before the Avengers suffered their greatest defeat. They can give Thor  bring me Thanos!!  And the Bifrost and him taking down several ships but they can't let Bruce and Hulk work out their differences in the middle of the Cull fight?  I'm sorry but that's a total load of crap. And it robbed us of any on screen resolution of a character arc.,3

Its fun and funny to me.  I have a terrible sense of humor though. ,2
"I think he was giving Thanos all he could because Thanos would have murdered him if he gave any less. Also because if Thanos sensed him holding back for some reason he might have suspected something was going on, and then when Strange asks for Tony's life in exchange for the stone, Thanos might have just refused the deal and killed them both. But ultimately, he put in exactly as much effort as he saw himself put in in the 1 outcome. He wouldnt have tried to deviate from the 1 plan he knew 100  would work.",1

What really bugs me is that they could have fixed most of it with just some minor dialogue changes during the scene between Ancient One and Hulk. They were almost there. She had a magic diagram and everything. I feel like they could have made an explanation that would keep everything consistent without making time travel a magic fix-all solution.,1

"Hi Kevin Congratulations on an excellent saga! Thanks for doing an AMAA by the way. My question is short and simple. Here it goes... Have you ever looked back on past MCU films and wish that you or the rest of the studios could ve done differently? For example, are there villains you wish that you didn t want to kill off as you thought about using them in the future? Or closed a hero s arc differently? If so, what few examples can you give us? It ll be quite interesting!  Thanks!",1

Well you can argue it s Loki s fault for summoning  Heimdall and the biofrost to take Hela to Asgard. But then Thanos would ve still made his way to Asgard to kill half the people to take the Space stone while Thor and Loki are halting Hela on Earth. That d be crazy. Damn,3

I almost wonder if there is another title yet to be released, and they're just gonna go with this for now.",1
I m pretty sure Whedon purposely made it so we d think Hawkeye would die to later subvert our expectations with the Quick-Ass death. Pretty much two characters have died in order to keep Hawkeye around at this point.,1

About the only ones that I can think of that I wasn't a fan of were Cobie Smoulders as Maria Hill and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver. But, I mean...she also cast about 6 or 7 people that are literally ICONIC in their roles, so that just feels like nitpicking. She hit so many home runs, it just feels wrong to criticize the couple singles.",3

"Hulk is in a great spot story-wise for Marvel. He's injured so he could stay on the sidelines or retire, but he could easily join the fight if the story calls for it. His character could really go anywhere.

Ruffalo is really great though, so hopefully he sticks around.",1

I was just joking since it's come to be expected that male heros put on muscle for whatever reason. Colbert would be quite the choice though since like you said he already has experience with his character on Venture Bros. The only legitimate concern would be age since they probably want someone young they can keep around for the next ten years or so,1

There s a bunch of stuff on Amazon in the states.  It also looks like Marvel has a ton of official stuff on their site.  Not sure if that helps or not.  Good luck!,1
"Thats one thing, but what were seeing is a notably lighter picture.  Its definitely done on purpose and not from compression.  Pretty sure its because they expect a huge percentage of their users to be using computers/tablets/phones and they aren't usually good for dark content.

Keep in mind, just because Wolverine is introduced doesn't mean he'll be an X-Men right away. They can introduce him in another film or post credit scene and they can build up to him eventually joining an already established X-Men team which personally I think is the way to do it.",3
"No 1 post in 1 hour. Marvel payed the kerching for this one, all around the medias, Hail fucking corporate",0
Yeah I want them to have always existed because I want Wolverine to be hundreds years old. I want some of them to have a past. So I want them to go some sort of route where they ve existed. Maybe multiverse of madness merges universes by accident so they end up on avengers world. Idk. But the snap thing takes away from some characters.,1

"No, they wouldn't.  If they sold all Spider-Man properties for, say 7 billion, then they net a straight 7 billion right there. No production costs of movies (that would end up being complete trash let's be honest), and they can use the time that would have gone toward Spider-man movies to make other films and make even *more* money. It really wouldn't be that bad a deal for either side.",2

"Indeed, both of the first films felt like an MCU side quest with a very flat romance sub-plot. Thor only shined in Avengers until Ragnarok. Marvel Studios obviously realized they didn't have anywhere to go with Thor for a third movie without some drastic changes so people actually gave a shit. Ragnarok literally destroyed Asgard, killed Odin, and totally re-set Thor as a Guardian which is totally working for me now. Infinity War was surprisingly good as well largely because of this change.",3

Proving my point - roughly 62  of the films (13 of 21) have been about large scale domination which is cheap and played out. It gets old!

What you said here ties in to the main point of the character that many people don't get. His purpose is to show that even the strongest man in the world can't save everyone. He still fails. He is often faced with problems that he can't just punch to death and he is forced to be a leader and inspire others to make true change. His character shows the importance of having strong personal character instead of just physical strength. This is why he is inspiring.,1

Superman had never been in a fight before and just learned how to use his powers. His carelessness in MOS was the foundation of the conflict in Batman vs Superman.

Ah yes! Now i have the motivation to get these finals done!,1
"The next line is about fighting Dr. Strange, which we also saw in the trailer. But i doubt it would go the exactly the same way it did in that story as their motives for going to earth in the Infinity (2013) event was a quite bit different than in IW",1

"The reasons are pretty simple really. In critics eyes, IW's balls-to-the-walls CGI-filled action + shitload of characters(with not much development, only Thanos got the majority of it) just seems overkill and exhausting to them. Meanwhile, Endgame had great character development and moments for the few heroes, down-to-earth drama, barely any CGI-filled action until the climax, plenty of time for the story to breathe. Critics fucking love those things.  Time travel rules? They don't give a shit about it.",1

The beginning of the trailer is like homage to Iron Man 1 when he s in the cave! Oh man I can t wait.,1
Also props to all the other directors for turning the project down,1
That was leftover footage from TDW.,2
Is there a reason it doesn't say so on the box office website?,1
I feel like if they would have made it back to Earth before the battle in wakanda they would have had a shot at beating Thanos all as one big team rather than taking turns fighting Thanos with a depleted team. Plus then Thanos wouldn t have been able to reverse time if Wanda destroyed Visions stone. They would have literally easily stopped him from getting all 6,1
"Now that you say it, there could have been a really cool scene on Titan where Strange opens a portal around thanos' gauntlet hand, like what he did to Cull Obsidian, but it can't close it. Would have been a great way to show off his raw strength without the gauntlet (although they did a pretty good job of that with the hulk fight). It almost seems like they were setting that up, but cut it out cause it didn't really make sense with strange already knowing what didn't work",1
Man at this point if they don't give him a screening I'm gonna boycott the movie. ,1
A literal duck hunt. Good luck!,1

He got big yes but it wasn't all Affleck for the  suit (http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/local-news/batman-made-in-ferndale-gym-owners-image).,1
Hopefully i'm not the only one confused on why there's only a few either looking at the camera or facing right?? Hints?,1
"How do you manage to decide which characters and franchises to move onto, like how does a character in the comic get a movie in the MCU?",1
Hey Kevin! What superpower would you have if you had the choice?,0
Was there ever a moment where you just felt like giving up after a movie failing or getting a ton of backlash?  I love what you ve done. Thank you.,1
"Man, he should've been the one to fuck up Thanos's ships in EG. They straight up nerfed him just so Marvel would look better and he STILL ended up more likable. I really hope they can fix Captain Marvel, otherwise we'll get stuck with a shitty character for a whole phase. x200B Then again, Thor wasn't all that cool before Ragnorak either and they made him awesome. Then again again, he didn't come across as bitchy either. Idk, I hope they can make Marvel better.",1
"I think that s Star Lord between Falcon and Bucky, second from the left.",2
"I rlly wanted to download it to show my friends, with credit ofc, and thx to this I can. This is absolutely amazing",2
After the events of Endgame how does Doctor Strange protect Earth without his greatest weapon (the Time Stone)?,1
That diddent age well.,1
"they split one book into two movies, that s not really the same thing ",1
He seems to deeply care,0
"It's an incredibly shitty thing to have happen to you, believe me.",1
What can you tell us about Shang-Chi?,1
"I think it's his way of saying  Look guys, what I'm doing really isn't *that* bad, y'know? I've got the full ability to just fucking delete everyone, but I'm being nice enough to let 50  of you keep living. See? Not evil. Totally justified. Get over it. ",1
Life-long marvel fan here! Thanks for all you've done to bring these characters and stories to life! Do you have a favorite character? Or maybe a top few without a particular order?,1
I don t see Antman,2
I will never understand how people over 12 can watch super hero movies and actually enjoy them. ,0
Feels like they already did that exact thing in the actual Guardians movie.,0
"What are the odds Tony comes back as a cosmic being? or at the very least an AI? I know people say to get over it, but I am choosing not to. Bring back Tony. Please.",1
Yeah it felt way too marvel-y to me,0
Not to mention the countless times spent honing and creating spells while trapping Dormammu in a time loop. No telling how long it would take a cosmic being like that to actually feel like he had been beat.,1
Asking for a friend.,1
"I agree that it makes perfect sense, because Dr. Strange keeps track of nystical threats. Loki is a magic user, Thanos isn't. And it could also easily be that he doesn't have a very exhaustive list yet.  We need to come up with those actual reasons. Asgard is not another universe or dimension, and Thanos and Loki are equally alien.",1
"They said Iron Man, not Tony Stark. Iron Man could come back somehow if they make a new character who uses the armor",1
That is so fricking cool!!!!,1
"Now that you mention Bruce, he doesn't seem to be in uniform with the others...",2
"Jude Law is way too big of a star to be a sidekick, and he's not old enough to be a trainer/mentor.   He *could* be her Kree senior officer that turns out to be a Skrull in Captain Marvel 2, but odds are he's today's bad guy. ",0
"Hypothetically, RDJ would probably be a great villain",2
"Unless you re a plane, or a bomb, or some ice, or a brainwashed buddy, or a Spider-Man, THEY DON T NECESSARILY HAVE TO YIELD!",1
"They don't play the classic Avengers music! *Correction, Avengers are no longer themselves*",1
Uh..,3
Skyrocketed raccoon,3
"Reminds me of that film 50/50. Everythings going well for guy, shows his gf, him running, healthy guy. Then bam. ",0
Agent Maria Hill should have been included instead of Loki,1
"This was a while ago, but they also made the *best* live action Spiderman there has ever been. Into the Spider Verse tells me that Sony probably learned to give creative control to talented studios. I have no doubts Sony will be fine if Disney keeps pushing them away.",1
We're all dying. ,0
glad it isn t called annihilation that sounded so shit,1
 I  actually  prefer  him  like  this.,1
"I m thinking his second appearance after the sequel to FFH will be an Avengers film, he needs to be front and center. Would also be a good way to influence another deal after this ones over",1
"And because of his special and intimate relationship, was almost like losing a loved one",2
How much extra footage have you saved for Robert Reynolds?,1
I think they try to make it seem bigger even though they just chose specific characters to kill off for their convenience.,1
I thanos and this is my galaxy. ,1
Who s someone you re dying to add into a movie?,1
"That theme gives me all the chills, that looks amazing",1
Hows your day?,1
"You mean the woman who won best actress a year or two ago? Edit: also, name checks out.",2
"Upon reflection, you are right. I apologize for referring to Mr. Gunn as a pedophile without evidence.",0
That man lived a full life. ,1
"If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.",3
Liz Olsen was best on Jimmy Kimmel,1
Toilet purposes yes. Discussion? Not till after. ,2
"As, for this",1
Yeah Push!! I totally forgot about that flick!,1
Maleficent?,0
hellz yeah we did!!!,1
The issue is people will only think the other side is guilty and needs to change. They'll think they're doing it to 'the right people' and its ok then.,1
"Is OP comparing HD Blu-ray instead of UHD, maybe?",1
"If we choose to become a society where we never allow anyone to grow, nobody will grow and that is the most dangerous thing",3
"I, uh, think you forgot her powers. She could just vacuum seal herself in that.",3
I've always liked it. I've had watches that were less fun than others but it's pretty solid.  I recommend Black's  The Nice Guys . Underrated film.,1
"I m aware, which is why saying Hulk was a supporting character is a large mischaracterization",2
I hope Jeremy Renner/Hawkeye is in this film. They could make it about Widow being recruited into Shield and partnering with Barton. I really loved them in Endgame.,1
Then don't buy smart shit it's not that hard.,2
"Yes, around the time of SDCC she was confirmed.",1
"A cultural phenomenon needs to be lasting.  Star Wars was a cultural phenomenon.  Harry Potter was a cultural phenomenon.  The MCU is a cultural phenomenon. When the only thing people remember from Avatar was blue people and unobtanium, that's a cultural fad",1
How is it *not* offensive? It's not like any movie critic chose to be a white man.,0
"Yup, that's definitely a *Captain Marvel* trailer. ",1
"They don't care if it's good, they care if it makes money. Spider-Man will pretty much always make money unless they really really mess it up. They can continue rebooting every 3 films, churning out mediocre crap, and they'll still make money.",1
"TDW is about Thor and Loki s relationship, and Thor finding his place in the world, which is giving up the Asgardian quests and being on Earth, where he feels he has meaning.",3
I love what they did with Prof. Hulk in the movie but personally i dont think they earned using him.,1
can t get over how good this photoshop is,1
I'd really really be surprised if it was that long. ,1
I think it would be amazing! Origin stories are always wanted as they engage the cinematic audience. Something fresh but familiar.,1
 I'm gonna go kill yakuza! ,0
"I would love that. Not necessarily with Street Fighter: The Game, but any fighting game where 4K PS4 Pro characters square off against 16-bit era MK digitised sprites with about 5 moves.",2
Happy trails space cowboy ,1
You should! It's one of if not the best solo movie in the MCU. It's my favorite. Made me a fan of Captain America.,1
> middle Eastern chick my memory is a bit foggy but I dont remember anything in particular about her ethnicity in the show,2
"Dude, from the moment Thor forged Stormbreaker until the end of IW is basically an evidence",1
Thats why she looked familiar to me... *Au pair*,1
lol no he hasn t - he can do that in his own tv show. this film should be from Nat s perspective.,2
My mistake then. I thought this last one was the end.,1
"In fairness, that shot could be anything. Could be alternate universe that never happens. Could be Tony fever dream. Could be altered for the trailer and look totally different in final cut.",1
Damn. Will they just chilling him into future movies now?,1
"I only used the high school comparison because I'm a shut-in who doesn't talk to people anymore lmao, it honestly applies to anyone who used to belong to a subculture where it was common to say things that would be considered offensive by the mainstream culture of today.",0
Ugh if only he had made thousands of child rape  jokes  though then everything would be gravy...,0
The lettering could use some work. There is so much air. And two words should mostly never be above one short word.,1
FOREVER YOUNG,2
Hi Kevin! Id ask a question if I had a great one but alas I do not. Just wanted to say we all love you and truly thank you for all the memories you helped shape for us and every other person in this world the last 10 years.  Heres to another 10! (If youre not burnt out already),1
"Out of the loop, what s excelsior",3
I can 100  see him doing that hahaha he seems the type to have a Golden Retriever for his spirit animal,1
"Hi Kevin, quick question here. Is the goal of the MCU to have Carol fill the role of someone like Superman ( very powerful central figure)? Or she intended to be used sparingly because of her huge power level?",1
Ahhh yeah. I forgot Origin existed. Thanks for ruining my bliss!  ),1
Man...just like Highschool Football.,1
"Yeah Morty, now let's check the microverse battery",1
Did Stan Lee film his cameos for Captain Marvel and Avengers 4? Being in every movie of the first three MCU phases would be a great achievement. RIP,3
Here we go again,1
Lol im an idiot,3
"Hi Kevin, Subjetively speaking, what are your: top 3 mcu movies, and your top 3 most intresting/favorite characters in the mcu?",1
Absolutely not worth watching. Love your username!,1
Seductive *GOD* of Thunder!,3
"I need help, cause I was just thinking to start watching it, does this mean it doesn't gonna end? They series it's not getting a final?",1
 I see you copied  his  beard... ,1
"> and then just travels back.. If so, he should have shown up in the machine, not sitting on a suit in the bench.  They pretty firmly established that when you travel back, you show up in the machine. > the laziest part about that scene was that they didnt show him travel back for the dramatic effect And what, everyone was distracted and didn't notice him coming back, changing out of his time-travel suit, and going over to sit on the bench?",1
And people in the YouTube comments were saying she had a deadpan face and no emotions whatsoever.  I think this is why I like Reddit comments more. ,3
* YOU RE MOVING IN WITH YOUR AUNTIE AND YOUR UNCLE IN BEL AIR! * ** FACEPUNCH **,3
*surprised detective pikachu face*,2
Grab dat gem!,3
Dude thank you for creating the greatest cinematic story every told.  What s your favorite kind of sandwich and why?,1
Hopefully we get her in Shield season 7. I feel like theres a decent chance.,1
It s kind of hard to beat  Portals  for that moment in the movie.,1
Oh my god why didn t they add this in the movie???!,3
Can't wait for all the drax interactions ,1
"I want the X-Men. Not Wolverine and Friends. Not Mystique and Friends. Not Professor X and Friends. I want the X-MEN, a team, a family, a community.",3
Where the fuck was Rocket.     Edit: what the fuck where was Rocket,3
No no it would of been a bad move for anyone to criticize that movie for any reason.,0
"To be fair though, those guys were already bald by the time really good hair transplants became widespread",3
I m avoiding trailers for the MCU.  Could anyone let me know if the trailer says when tickets go on sale?  I m assuming/hoping soon since this trailer just dropped,1
This legitimately looks crazy. I don't think there's ever been so much CG in unison with the environment like this before. Just look at the shot of the Wakanda shield. You can see everything happening.,1
"And this is why I love Iron Man 3, because Shane Black gets the best comic performances out of RDJ",1
"You have that backwards, Sony wanted to keep the original deal and walked out when Marvel refused, and Marvel was trying to negotiate their contract Google it fam",1
My man!  ,2
"*oh*, SNAP!",3
Will there be more Thor movies like Ragnarok? That movie was perfection. Thank you for being so good at what you do and bring us all so much joy!,1
It was about politics to start. ,3
So damn excited,1
So shocking...,1
"It's really great that you're doing an AMA here. I know you're not supposed to talk about the future movie lineup, but we all want to know the answer to one question: are there any plans for a Luis movie?",1
"That s why you dont see stuff like that happening all the time. Not to sound horrible, but its pretty obvious when someone is seriously ill.",1
My guess is Hank Pym set him up with the house post Ant-Man and pre Civil War.,1
I thought I was on drugs when I saw that,1
Pepper Potts is still around. At this point Tony probably had Iron Man suit repairs/construction automated. She'll have access to all that. Now creating updated suits thats probably not happening unless Wakanda gets involved.,1
Yeah I saw that. Curious. Wonder if she s a stand in for someone else? ,1
What was your favorite Stan Lee cameo? Thank you for everything you have done. You should be very proud of yourself,1
"Good. Half the crop, double the profits.",2
How do you know? He's never done anything near that scale.,1
That's the origin of the word but modern use doesn't mean 10 ,3
"Two weeks ago, I made that comment two weeks ago, yes I ve realised now, sorry I m bad at recognising faces you cunt.",1
MARVEL: I am inevitable...,1
"Since when is budget (or reach) a factor in whether something has more or less prestige? Most arthouse films have a really small budget compared to Hollywood stuff, but carry a lot of prestige and certainly aren't beneath Hollywood films. Also, those same arthouse films have way less reach than Hollywood films.",0
>Ohhh snap!,3
"Well that s impressive, it doesn t even look like cardboard. I totally thought it was a wood carving",3
Not enough humor in the 30 second trailer? gee,2
It is an easy way to start the action/plot.,1
"After the CM trailer a bunch of people were complaining that Brie Larson should smile more in the movie and that she lacked personality. The  smile more  is a common sexist criticism of women, but moreover, her goddamn character is a brainwashed warrior slave and no one seemed to consider how that may affect how often she smiles. ",3
I need to rewatch that film... I like the ideas of it and maybe that's all you need for a moment to be remembered... But as I remember it it all felt a bit forced and ehhhhh in execution. Yeah deffo need a second viewing,1
"Well yeah. He's not legally able to be a superhero (at the beginning of the movie at least - it's possible the Accords could get repealed or put on hold or simply ignored while Thanos is a threat), and he abandoned the shield. So he's given up the identity, for now at least.",3
 I want pictures of Spidey vs Venom! ,1
What happens to letting a Director s merit define his career instead of dredging up old bullshit.,1
u/scarredsquirrel,1
and the end game is terrifying ,1
"Jon snow was 100  dead too, though... ",1
"- 1) To ensure the wider audience doesn t burn out from the comic book hero scene, how spread out are the plans for the various phases? - 2) what advances in movie making in the future will help you get over current limitations for introduction of some of the crazier elements like the cosmic entities , overpowered characters going at full strength, and storylines like Time Runs Out? - 3) do you plan on expanding on some of the less talked about storylines of popular characters eg Rune King Thor?",1
She will be the 2nd. Captain Marvel was the first.,1
Should've went for the HEAD!!!!,1
Heart breaking to say the least. Every more so to the people close to him. Love you stan thanks for giving us everything!,1
Wow Gamora is an asshole in this clip. Only one who didn t take a knee,1
 reeeeeee!  - you,0
How many times is this gonna get reposted,1
Maybe FFC was referring to only certain filmmakers.,1
"I pray that the marvel netflix shows are still canon, pleeeeeease marvel, dont let them go to waste!",1
...and yet he still didn't go for the head. Shoulda gone for the head.,1
"Now bring back all the canceled Netflix shows, don't care what platform.",1
"There's no way they are playing them, those GameBoy's aren't backlit so they should be holding them at the most awkward angles imaginable to catch the right amount of light on the screen.",1
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO *ugly cry*,1
Stark - Endgame Cap - Winter Soldier Thor - infinity war Hulk - Avengers  Widow - endgame  Barton - Ultron,3
Will you make a dead pool short please. Just him poking fun.,1
I haven't laughed at a joke like that in a while. It would be a funny interaction even if Dr Strange wasn't his actual name.,1
Cap stopping Thanos' punch? Cap is the soul stone confirmed!,1
These are adorable! You should take it further and draw entire characters and then maybe turn it into a T-shirt or hoodie.,1
Especially women.,2
"is there any possibility for multiple spider men, or a spider verse?",1
"In these cases it's almost always a rough cut that the person gets to see, but it's still better than nothing.",1
 Oh yeah ? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtrmWnFAHYE),2
Because it s her name and nobody dares shorten it?,1
It's bloody good work. You earned it,1
My roommate for 3 years played all the Uncharted games. I watched him through all of it. He'd always asked if I wanted to play but I always refused. It was just so fun to watch!,2
They did lie about the title so I'd take what they say with a grain of salt.,2
They did one with DC,1
How long ago do you think 142 days is?,3
"I think they ll nail Doctor Doom, but I hope they still have him tied to the FF closely. Him and Osborne both should be overarching villains that have natural and organic buildups.",2
I wouldn t go THAT far.Hollands suit looks equally if not more amazing. Red and black looks awesome,1
"Eh, it's a bit much... ",0
"BOOM, you lookin for this?",1
Hahahahahahaha no.,1
 HERe'S My unpOPULAr OpinIOn THat'S actUaLLY pRetty popULAr BuT i jUsT wANT uPVoTEs aND KaRMa! ,1
It's still too flippant. Just ask the Warriors Three. Only Hogun got an honorable death.,1
"There would be so much radiation, a third transformation would make him Edward Norton",3
The only complaint I have is this doesn t do Zendaya s beauty justice  . . . . . (That s a joke guys I actually love this picture),1
If you were to get ONE superhero from the.. you know  neighbors  who would it be and how does Batman would fit into the MCU?,1
"Jake Phelps dies, James Gunn reinstated. My heart can t take today. ",1
It s going to be weird when iron man is up for a reboot.  Whoever is in charge of filling Robert Downey s shoes is going to have a hard time,1
Yeah the fact that not a single persons face is obscured by someone else s gives it away. That would never happen naturally in a photo with this many people. If you scan the faces of everyone you can make out each face fully.,1
BEAT COMMENT,1
I could live with this.  She was really great in that role!,2
"Is it canon that the Avengers can go to anywhere in Time and Space? It s a bit tricky that they have time travel via Hank Pym, but that s.... Not the most unreasonable thing that happens in comics, I guess",1
Why are you here?,2
K Mart,1
I'm just waiting for two words in the movie: Avengers. Assemble. ,3
"Suck it up, buttercup.",0
Wow! This looks insanely good!,1
Join us! https://www.ironbutt.org/rides/,3
"It s refreshing to see an actor really be into their massive character and their respective universes. All too often I read stuff like  main Harry Potter cast *hated* working on the movie,  even in the MCU there are rumors that Chris Evans, Hemsworth, and RDJ were tired of their roles in the MCU. I mean I get it, but it s nice to know that they actually enjoy the roles of a lifetime, the story, the epicness, etc.",3
I see they're going with the  Hawkeye is our secret weapon .,3
You re right. A real loving  partner would never want to succeed in their chosen field. Super selfish. Chris should ve known his place as  chubby dumb guy  and stayed in it.,1
Huge battle in Wakanda? My body is SO ready.,1
Who is the hero at the top right corner?,1
"Wait, I thought all the characters only got a trilogy?",1
"You realize it's possible to critique something and still enjoy it, right?  Like, that's not lost on you?",1
Kind of funny the title ended up being end game.  Russos said none of the characters in IW said the title? ,1
Belly too small for buddy Thor.,1
only 6 movies in phase4 ?,1
"got it, thanks!",1
I don't mind if the whales pay for it so I can get it for free.,1
"Fuckin neckbeards, why can't I enjoy a post without downvotes?",0
He s a Donald lover  ,1
"Interesting...Thanos only had 2 stones when fighting Cap. It was clearly in the jungle   the Russos have confirmed the Wakanda fight is at the end. So intentional misdirection, or does Thanos not get all of the stones? ",1
"My initial impression too. Amazing editing, by far. I was hoping the avengers theme would come into play at some point though.",1
I'm all for it but those poor children probably think they're dying now,0
I hope she returns as Death,3
Yeah the choreography in TAS was already pretty lame I'll give it that. Spider-Man swing kicking all day long,1
The context of the pic tho,1
Captain America The First Avenger is kind of a loss too. Sure he beats Red Skull but in doing so he has to sacrifice himself to crash the plane and leave behind the woman he loves. He never got that dance. ,1
I got my mom into the marvel universe and she loves Thor,1
Who is your favorite superhero out of the comics and the mcu?,2
Tooch ! Post credits could be the bridge between the two. Really interested to see where Capt Marvel finishes and Endgame begins. ,1
"He said  one of  Paul, don't get your circuits in a twist.",3
Marvel should cast him as another new hero with weirdly similar arachnid powers and the memory of Peter Parker. Arachnid-Dude.,1
"I'd say she's way more interesting than Hawkeye, or at least was until endgame. Now they're maybe tied. Through the series she's gotten character development, evolving relationships with other characters, and a mysterious background. Hawkeye has been the same dude the whole time (until now). Just a family man doing good to provide for/protect his family.",1
Luke Cage!,1
First one looks way to confusing,1
AHHH HURRY UP APRIL,0
"maybe theres a gem near the thumb, you dont see it at that angle",1
Huh... you don't have to go see a movie.,1
It was also followed by footage of Rocket and Captain Marvel piloting the space ship together as Rocket is asking the Avengers if any of them have been in space before not to throw up.,2
"I don t see the difference between that and a god to be honest.  Ego had the power of creation, near immortality, incredible destructive power and was a living fucking planet. If that isn t enough to be considered a god then I don t know what is. Even in most earth religions most of the gods aren t on his level. Some control water, others are gods of medicine. It s a pretty vague term.",3
"Hopefully hawkeye will be useful in this, as I want to like the character, but he seems kinda boring to me imo.",1
No I found some dude s music whose name is Tom Holland. Some album  Waves.  It s pretty decent but I had the hardest time fitting the voice to our Tom in my head,2
"Yeah my life is over once I see Endgame, and everything that happens after that is just extra ",3
Blasphemy.,2
I was extremely shocked as I gave up on the likelihood of this. I am not sure if Disney is admitting they were wrong as they are not commenting on his rehiring.. but they are showing that they can be human and forgiving. Not often do you see someone brought back like this after being thrown under the bus ,1
Wagner Moura is probably more well-known in the USA.,1
This truly made my day ,1
BEEN ONE WEEK SINCE YOU LOOKED AT ME,1
Bacon cheeseburgers,1
ant-man as the stinger?,1
"If not then they should just have Deadpool, good comedic replacement and fits the fourth wall breaking narrative",1
"I don't think it's at that level yet, or at least not most of the time.",2
"Strange, the Guardians and Spider-Man came back from Titan. Valkyrie, Korg, Miek and the Asgardians came from New Asgard in Norway. The Ravagers from Contraxia. Black Panther and his army from Wakanda. And I assume Wong and the Sorcerers came from the 3 sanctums and Kamar-Taj.",2
"They had a pretty solid supporting cast. Natalie Portman was fresh off an Oscar win and Anthony Hopkins always brings a lot of credibility. Hugo Weaving is mildly famous, I think the average audience would recognize him but not know his name. Captain America was a bit smaller in its casting with the biggest name being Tommy Lee Jones.",1
He'll probably have a cameo in Spider-Man: Far From Home though. That one would be his send off.,1
" Where do we go, now that Phase 4 has ended? ",1
Pom is the first one to sign the company birthday card and leave no space for anyone else  ,3
Neither did Gunn,1
THE biggest movie ever.,1
It was the absolute perfect timing along with the music. That Silvestri score got the heartstrings going.,1
"You're paying such a high markup for the brand. You can get custom suits that would cost 10k if they were name brand for  2,500 if you go custom. Obviously can scale down as well, I have several suits that would cost me 3,000 for  700 to  900. They also fit a lot better. 1,800 for a trench coat is reasonable though.",1
An adaptation of the Secret Wars crossover would be the best way to close the UCM?,1
 NET NEUTRALITY!!! (url),0
umm why the fuck was this cut???,1
At least I m not a a little man-child,2
Maybe the critics like how much of a failure it is?,1
Hey Kevin! Thanks for everything you and the folks you ve collaborated with accomplished with what seemed like an impossible undertaking just 10 years ago.  What I m just wondering is how early into the process was Infinity War and Endgame planned or was it more organic as the films continued?,1
Will the Russo Brothers return to direct any other Marvel films in the future?,1
/r/killthecameraman,1
"Something that is going to bug me... Far From Home ended with >!the world finding out Peter Parker is Spider-Man! And I thought, I don't care for this, BUT I guess it fits the MCU better.  It would better tie him in with Tony Stark and the MCU. Without the MCU, it just feels like part of his story is missing.",3
I ve seen Atmos in theaters and it shakes my guts. My Bose sub already literally shakes all the pictures in my house. This is going to be amazing. I wonder where you go to adjust the settings for that speaker,1
Remember when people were worried Game of Thrones would hurt the box office for Endgame?,1
But it's two close range weapons in one.,1
"Basically their whole ideology, as I understand it, is this:  White people are superior to everyone else, but that's racist so we just project that superiority by virtue signaling onto all the other races by bigotry of low expectation. Also, sense we are superior, we should be ashamed for that and hate ourselves and be racist to white people instead because reasons ",0
"He also has a small, barely recognisable role in Groundhog Day.",1
So will Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D acknowledge the snap at all?,1
"The views have been at 467,331 views for a few hours now Weird",2
Can't wait for the CGI suit cosplay!,3
thanos is  brutal (url),1

This. Couldn't agree more. Avatar is dogshit.,1
Stunningly gorgeous. But enough about me. You look fantastic.,1
God I hope this is the one where cap Says **Avengers Assemble!**,1
"I hope he reply to this one, please",1
Time for Thanos  Requiem ,1
Deadpool: My Super Sweet 16,3
atleast his face looks better than Superman CGI face.,2
I want to congrats too but I don't want to endorse traditional  comic-book  style which contributes to further suppress the modern replacement for comics  manga  as it's called by the Japanese.  ,0
"I expect he IS doing that, at the same time he really wants to see Endgame as it is extremely clear he is a huge Marvel fan.  You wanna show some respect?",3
It s worth seeing just for Korg alone,3
Rumored to come out dec 3rd,1
Pretty Wasp'y to me.,0
What has been your favorite movie released in the MCU so far?,1
Genuinely disappointed that she's only now just discovered by the general public that is superhero movie fans. She deserves it. but I will always announce my unwanted opinion on marvel bs.,0
Haha me too thanks,1
Cue* neckbeards  Cue means to signal.  Queue means a line of people.  ,2
"hey now lets be adult about this situation, she didnt say too many black men where at her press junkets",0
I came here just to find this,3
"Jude Law could be set up as the Sinestro of the movie, depending on which direction they want his arc to go in.",1
mouth looks like a skull,2
Tony. Bring him back. No explanations. Everyone in the MCU just pretends he didn't die. That's it.  You can't get any stupider than that.,3
I heard they ran out of purple so they had to use gold for 1 hand. And then they had some rocks so they said  fuck it  and threw them on. ,1
I put up our tree on Nov 1. I feel like an actual psychopath now.,0
When was Daredevil cancelled?,1
"Ragnarok really respected the source material, what are you on about?",3
Infinity War was the same way. Pretty sure Civil War too,1
> where boi,2
you read my mind! ,1
Anything will be better than that God awful Topher Grace version. No I didn't watch  Venom. Wasn't interested at all.,0
Thanks both of you for clarifying!,1
"Funny how he's like, Ok, time for some real fire power now.  and everyone gets excited, ahh yeah, break out the big guns! and it's a sword.",3
True. I'd say that Strange  abusing  the time stone is really what pushed him over though. ,2

How is your experience with being a director for such big movies?,1
So they were asked which character they would put as Moon Knight as PART of an interview. They were just spitting things out. And you take that as them not caring about Moon Knight? An interview is hardly the final word. You fucking idiot.,0

"What if Marvel added to endgame and in an alternate reality Peter Parker did the final snap and Iron Man didn t die. Would Marvel be able to end SpiderMan s run at least temporarily? Technically, Marvel should have rights to do this?",0
I do kind of miss when every superhero movie wasn t on a worldwide or galactic level. I feel like every movie I ve seen the past few years has been at a super big level. Civil War was refreshing because it was just about them and honestly wouldn t have really had an effect on anyone else outside the team. I d love to see a superhero movie just about saving one person. I suppose Batman might be better suited for a movie like that tho.,1
"Not really their fault, Marvel Studios didn't disclose anything with them about Endgame at all, they didn't know anything about the movie so they have to treat it as if it didn't happen for now at least.",2
"Do you remember how Joe Russo mentioned the Defenders were nearly in Infinity War? I think he meant that they were nearly in the final battle of Endgame. Makes more sense, but he couldn't spill the beans back then. http://collider.com/avengers-infinity-war-netflix-marvel-characters/",1

Goddamn Jake Gyllenhaal is hot. Thanks for attending my ted talk.,1
considering he was teased at the end of guardians 2 and has not been created there is no way he will show up in captain marvel only at the end or post credit scene but i doubt he will be included.,1

Right? Sony needs to put the brakes on the spinoffs. Let s first see if Venom 2 is good to prove the first Venom wasn t a random fluke.,1

I'm nobody. And I'm late to the post but I want you to know that I find this truly awe inspiring as a compilation and hope that if ever a complete MCU IM to EG saga is released that this is strongly considered for the culminating trailer.,1

"I definitely think this will sway public opinion on Gunn's firing, with virtually the entire cast of GotG coming out in support of him, and having a well thought out response to what happened.  I wondered why they were silent, collectively, for some time but I'm glad they all took the time to write this and not rush. It's good to see them stick by their friend.",3

"I meant Thor 1. I don t know man. I ve always thought that movie and it s depiction of Asgard was gorgeous. The entire first act, before Thor is cast out of Asgard, has some of my favorite moments in the MCU. It s not my favorite MCU film overall, but I still love it.",1

"Bad Twitter jokes and actual assault/harassment of individuals are completely separate issues. Not that I m defending what Gunn tweeted, but nothing about it was illegal or directly harmful. I mean damn how can you even compare Cosby, a literal rapist, to someone who said rude things on the internet over a decade ago? Cosby was tried in the court of law, not of public opinion.",3
Why didn t Captain Marvel put on the Gauntlet and beat up Thanos without snapping? Why didn t Thor? Why did no character think about using the power of the gauntlet without the suicide snap?,1
Truth. It's a top 5 Spideman story. Easily. First game that's made me cry.,3
Drax is like... I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... Watch.,1
Thanos gets the reality gem on the basis that he is too smart to dick around with it and too egomaniacal to use it in his favor (he'd be admitting he is too weak/cowardly to do the thing himself.).,3
Your comment really made me realize how important that scene is. Man. It was also important to keep Tony alive so he could invent time travel. If Thanos blasts Tony right there there s no chance he ever loses or the events of Endgame ever happen. Crazy to think about.,2
Russos  explanation obeys the rules of time travel established in the film. Markus and McFeely s explanation breaks it,3
"Oh yay, another Iron Spider movie",0
Oh my god thank you. I literally lost it at this scene. The lady next to me probably thought I was crazy but it was literally the last 11 years of my life all on the same screen. And then I finally composed myself just to lose it again when Tony died. From tears of happiness to tears of sadness so quick,3
"Because TASM didn't make enough money and wasn't nearly as popular as MCU's Spidey.  I wish there was a split too - not necessarily TASM, but a different a Spider-Man for the Venom-verse (really did *not* think that movie was good and don't really see how Holland's Spider-Man fits in it), but I understand why Sony doesn't want that. They see how popular Holland is and want his draw to put butts in seats.",3
 Todd is superman.,1
That salute at the end takes this video from very cool to life changing. ,3
"I think what he's meaning is that Hemsworth hasn't been able so far to convert his success in the MCU to success outside the MCU that some of his peers have managed. Since he hasn't been able to do so, he's all too happy to keep returning to the role that's paying the bills, whereas the rest of the cast has options.",2
"Watch Snowfall on FX, it's really good, he was also in an episode on the 5th season of Black Mirror",0
When it shows Tony gazing out the window of the ship it looks like he's wearing one of Quill's jackets.,1
Wao!,2
ahhhh Falcon *fans self cause he is so HOT*,1
">It's like they took blockbuster-style films, created a scientific formula, and distilled them down to nothing but the most broadly appealing parts. So... they made more blockbusters? Oh god, the horror!",1
Truly. Two episodes in and I'm already preaching the gospel of this series to everyone I meet.,2
It should be a meta commentary about the merger.  No way Deadpool doesn t talk about it.,1
"If you look through his post history it s pretty clear he isn t. Asking about estate stuff, drugs that can t be mixed. Previous medical problems.  That d be a long game to play. ",0
That part with Thor meeting the Guardians was leaked. We've seen it already.,1
If not in the film then hopefully at least in the marketing,1
It ll probably still break records even if they uploaded the entire movie to YouTube right now.,3
So I thought the Russo s said that there d be a time jump... or maybe it was just a theory on here. Looks like Endgame takes place right after IW so what are we thinking about the time frame??,1
"Hi Kevin, can we please have Kang the Conqueror in the MCU. I don't mind how. Just please... I'll do anything. Thanks.",1
Shame the new films wont come close to what they've already done,1
There was another scene in the fight where Scott is shoving one through a portal! Just cought it in my last viewing.,3
Commenting to show my undying love and eternal hype for this franchise,1
"I mean,  angry guy with shocking whips  was one of the successful ones. He just wanted to f'up Tony's doings, make him bleed, knock him off his high horse. He did that. Problem was that there were three acts remaining to the film afterwards. ",3
"Hello, Kevin Feige. I would like to start out by saying how grateful all of us are for the absolutely incredible vision you and everyone behind the scenes have executed in the past 11 years of the MCU. I have two questions: Is there any particular bizarre/lesser know character that you'd like to see introduced or given a solo outing in the future of the MCU? Has there ever been talks (or even jokes) about giving Seth Green's Howard the Duck a proper solo movie in the MCU?",1
White isn't an ethnic group?  Why does it make sense to offer the global majority any extra support system in a country created by a minority?  Shouldn't we instead be trying to protect that minority on a global scale to ensure the continuing diversity of the planet?,1

Fuckin bout time. Avatar sucks butt,1
> It's kind of his jam as a god from outer space.  Not really. Asgard being in outer space and using advanced technology is really strange if you compare it to the comics. It's like if the Iron Man armor was a mystical armor from the middle ages. Thor's whole deal is being an actual genuine God walking among men.,2
Not only that but Cap knows Hydra has infiltrated SHIELD. Does he tell Peggy?,1

Killgrave was hot too. That doesn't mean he didn't rape Jessica.,3
I referred to him as the Credible Hulk.,1
"Nah let's do it in the first sequel to the franchise, and only give him 15-20 minutes in the movie tops. x200B Doomsday deserves his own movie against the Supes. It's such a good story that they threw away.",3
"Hey Kevin, just want to let you know you did an awesome job on the MCU. Making a 22 movie interconnected movie series shouldn't have been possible, but you pulled it off. Anyway, onto the questions:   * Which MCU movie was the most fun to work on and why?   * When did you first realise that the MCU was going to be something big? * What's your favourite ever comic book character (Marvel or DC)?   * Cap or Tony?

"Hi Kevin, big fan and beginning filmmaker here. Pun completely intended, but my endgame is to one day work for marvel studios in some capacity. Coming from someone who s risen all the way to the top, could you tell us what the best way is to get started on that journey?",1
Well he has captain marvel in his universe so there isn't anything really to worry to much about his realm.,1
If this whole acting thing doesn't work out for Chris Hemsworth maybe he can commiserate with his unfortunate brother Larry. ,3

"It is definitely canon, that was never the question. A lot of retractors mistake connected with canon. I hate Inhumans, but it is definitely canon.

Please no.,2
"I thought the moment he realizes he has to die is right when Thanos power stones away Captain Marvel, because it would only occur to Tony at this moment that he can steal away the infinity stones but that would mean he would die in the process. So he looks to Dr. Strange for confirmation that this plan is the one and Strange confirms it.",3
Is he missing a finger in that scene??,1

Musical continuity and beautiful imagery.  Marvel has crafted something truly special. It's been a pleasure guys, now let's enjoy this! Also come on never did I expect to see the Avengers in all out motherflippin WAR!  YEAH!!",3
"Hey Kevin, what was a particularly memorable part of producing Infinity War / Endgame? Were there any directions you wanted to pursue but couldn t or decided not to? Thank you!",1
"Are you retarded? Sony foots the bill for the movie, mcu acts like a director by giving creative input, what movies give the director a 50 percent cut of the gross? None because that's absurd. Sony owns the hero they have all the money to make with or without marvel. And on top of that Disney was getting merch sales in the deal not Sony, if you have no idea what you're talking about stfu",1
He traded buck for the hammer,1
"Also, if they go the horror path with Doctor Strange, all the more I can expect to see Ghost Rider or The Hood.",3
Did they... I think they did... they made Thanos look genuinely threatening.,1
Iron Spider suit looks good af,1
Couldn t do that in endgame tho,1
"These are all points that are true, but they go against your conclusion. When you take them into consideration, the 50/50 split look even worse than it did before.  Disney having 100  of the merch rights means they get free advertising from Sony's movies, meaning that a 50/50 split on a character they don't have the rights to is even more ridiculous.",1
You forgot the  learning from past mistakes and trying to make the best out of it  part.,1
Does anyone else think that Cap is going to play a strong role in getting Banner angry enough to utilize the Hulk like never before? The Hulk is supposed to be the strongest being potentially ever. Just depends on how mad he can get.,2

"You might have a point. But your point can't be validated for another 40 some odd years, maybe more with the new Star wars movies  being made",2
"I absolutely love it. Trailer literally shows nothing, but emotions have run high when you're watching this.",1
He lives to 95 and was able to see his creations at its prime. I think he lived a good life. ,2
"Hi Kevin, 1) Which Marvel movie soundtrack is your favourite? 2) What was running through your head the first time you saw the complete Avengers Assemble scene? 3) How early on did you have the main details of the whole Infinity Saga planned? Thank you so much for spearheading such a great cinematic movement for the past decade, it s really emotionally resonated with me and followed me through some really transformative years!",1
It actually is possible to only be  kinda worthy (url),3
"Honestly I dont. Endgame was the perfect wrap up, and Far from Home was a great epilogue. Black Widow just seems like overkill and I have almost no interest in it. I wouldn't mind if the MCU took at 5 year hiatus tbh.",0

But the Russo Bros. track record is pretty much unimpeachable at this point, so I have faith.",2
Delightful! You have pleased me. ,2
FARMER THANOSS FTW!!!!,1
"I mean dr strange wasn t to everyone s taste, I know quite a few people who thought the character was too big an asshole and said the movie wasn t enjoyable apart from the visuals. Personally I felt she nailed the Carol Danvers, nothing about her performance seemed robotic to me. The closest thing was sometimes it felt like she was holding her emotions back a little, which is the whole point of the character during the movie.",2
WHATEVER IT TAKES!!! ,3
Were you Team Cap or Team Iron Man?,1
There is nothing you can do to survive this shit???,1
"Thanks. Was thinking that but he looked a little odd. So that means that scene is likely after the return of Tony and/or Nebula, unless they are assuming those in space died. If it is in the movie anyway.",1
Good to note that these two films (well actually only Iron Man 1) weren t (was not) made under the Disney banner - it was initially Paramount. Disney bought Marvel in 2010.,2

"He didnt make 'a thousand' jokes. He made a small handful of them. Would you honestly bother to take the time to scour through 10000 tweets from nearly 10 years ago to delete the specific ones, or would you just batch delete them from a time you aren't proud of and already publicly apologised for?  I've heard far worse on South Park ffs",2
He literally says that the thing he's the best at isn't very nice.  That's sooooo Canadian.,2
Man they could not have casted the characters better. Every character looks and feels like I remember from the comics. Especially Dr Strange.,1

It's almost as if streaming a movie isn't as easy on a connection as having a light on a disc. Streaming it will probably never be as good as having a disc,1
We know Spidey won t stay dead. He has a movie coming out later in the year ,1
We see Cap before with the screens mentionning  missing  people. Scott is part of them. They think he got dusted and they're surprised he's there.,1
I m sure actors and their friends pop in an out all the time. Just because someone s extremely rich doesn t mean they can t drop by their friends house to see what s good. ,1
Does spidey have a long term future in the mcu? Some of us are a little nervous,3

"Asgard was set up in New Asgard the same city of Tonsberg, Norway where for frost giants attacked and Odin left the tesseract there for some reason when red skull found it. Unless he moves then to another world but he gave up rulership to Valkyrie. Also this would be the 2nd time he would be ruled after turning it down. Thor 2 he turns it down. Thor 3 he accepts he's a king to rule. Endgame he realizes he's not meant to be a king or at least not yet and gives up the job.",1
I wish the Netflix series was included with the movies. Daredevil and Spider-Man would be an amazing movie,3

"Maybe, but honestly it'll be hard to live up to what Endgame is. It's not just a fantastic Marvel/comic movie, it's a great movie by itself. You don't need all ten years of films to enjoy it, but at the same time it has those ten years behind it. Endgame is truly something special in cinema, and I don't honestly know if anything can ever truly live up to the legacy it's leaving.",3

I think it s perfect as is. Cut it from the movie and leave it as a fun little extra on the Blu-ray.  Especially since it almost seemed more like the actors were saying thanks to Robert Downey Jr. for getting this whole gravy train going with Iron Man than their characters being sad/respectful in the moment that Tony had died.,1

After seeing the Chaos Ultron created, Tony creates Vision without consulting the team. Tony joins Ross in pushing the Sokovia Accords, without consulting the team. Here, he ends up splitting the Avengers as a result.  Yes, Tony was quite selfish throughout the MCU FILMS. And Endgame shows tremendous growth.",2
Something about how the sky suddenly turns all dark and blue when he jumps in the air gives me goosebumps every time,1

"Tony, Thanos, cap and probably vision/Ultron at the end",1
I get that officially they aren't but they are all focused on in an Avengers movie or are a significant character with relation to an avenger. thats enough for me to consider them as avengers. Also Scott is in the endgame trailer hes definitely an avenger!,1

I can t think of an intelligent question so I just want to ask when do you think the incorporation of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four into the MCU will take place and if there s a more likely chance for them to be in movies and not a television series,1
Wow fuck you dude I hope Marvel fires you for having such a loose tongue,1
"YES!!!! I know him, he s a friend from work!",1
It s been cancelled so Season 3 is the last season and apparently Feige s plan is to cancel all the Marvel TV shows and then reboot them. We ll see if that is true.,0
The only way the next conclusion can ever come close is if they somehow find a way to bring back Tony and/or Cap. Without those 2 it'll never be the same in my eyes,1

It's because of marvel that I'll never have an answer when someone asks me  what's your favorite movie .",1

Yeah I m thinking this as well. I think Gunn wants the focus on the Guardians,3
Yeah I understand. Sort of like  I only knocked everyone away with 1-2 stones...but YOU..YOU made me bleed a little so you re gonna have to be turned to infinity stone dust for messin with me.. ,1
I remember not knowing anything about comic books when Iron Man was announced as the first Marvel movie that would lead into the Avengers. I thought for sure they would go with a  bigger name  like Captain America or The Hulk as the first movie. I didn t think they could pull it off. I  was wrong.,3

This whole thing is just a perfect storm of outrage. We've come to the point where no matter what you say on social media someone is going to use it to crucify you.

This is great news and honestly a surprise. Disney getting 25  of total revenue instead of 5  of opening day revenue + merchandising is a big deal. I guess Sony really saw the backlash and realised how much they would benefit from keeping him in the MCU.,1

Can you make ALF the movie?,1
Any non-youtube link?,0
Where are the other 3 cheese kings?,1
well you also got to think about the fact that the biggest reason. The avengers is as big as it is is because it became popular in the first place the original iron Man was a smash Hit. when something is popular it gains popularity just by being popular because people love what other people love. I think another really good reason DC has failed to match marvel when it comes to movies is just that they haven't released a film that really kicks off in the expanded universe well,1
That's aggressive for a dumb joke hahahah,1

"Scarlet Witch's power (in the MCU at least) was 'unlocked' by the Mind Stone, which implies that it is inherently scientific because the Infinity Stones are the fundamental building blocks of the universe.  Dr. Strange channels different dimensional and inter-dimensional energies that can be studied and replicated using technology (what Asgard does.) I don't know enough about Ebony Maw to comment, but it's safe to assume it's of a similar vein.  At the end of the day it's up to your definition of 'magic.'",2
"Also, that's not a picture of Kevin Fiege. It's actually Chris Pratt",1
What the actual fuck why did they cancel it!!!??? It is still one of my favorite shows on Netflix and I've seen a fuckton of different shows. If they didn't cancel all the other marvel series too thats stupid.,1
Please make them hire you to turn IW and EG into these in their entirety. Or do it without their permission. I don t need anything more than I need to read a whole book of these.,1
"Tony wasn t the only option for the power source, though. Just the one that most appealed to Loki s vanity.",1
"I feel like this is a great idea, but I can't think of a character that would be a big enough threat for more than one Avenger to tackle without wasting them too early on. What if it was something like Angel, Beast and Iceman who were together but they were scared and confused? They could only be acting in self-defense but accidentally causing panic and destruction around them. Double win because they were all in the original roster so it would be great to start the X-Men with them in the MCU.",1
Yeah. Super mad and it s super awkward to watch. Especially Ruff s weak attempt at backtracking.  ,3

I dont know how true that is, but I do know that Blurays can hold 25-50gb, while streaming file sizes are usually around 3-7gb (I think at least. It's been a while since I checked that number). Different codecs might have different colors",1

I feel like Iron Man 3 and The Dark World can be a bit of a slog after the first Avengers.  Having the comic relief after before things get serious is a nice flow.,1
What was the most difficult part of making the MCU?,1
Ehhh I wouldn t go that far. I have issues with the Hulk we ended up with but I think  he should ve been stronger  is a lame complaint,1

And myself and my friends overwhelmingly lean conservative.  The number of friends that I have speaking out against Trump, both now and throughout the election cycle, far outnumbers the friends that I have that support Trump. But the friends that are conservative but aren't religious are definitely more likely to support Trump.",3
Akira is such a weird fit for him. It s been a long time since I saw the movie but I do recall it not having much humour.,3
"> BUT Disney wanted to share both production cost and revenue 50/50, so its Disney's fault here. For making a stupid suggestion. What makes this a stupid suggestion? It's the story that will bring viewers past the initial release. It's the entire reason the MCU has lasted as long as it has. Is that only worth 5 ?",1
"I'm thinking the shot of Thor on another world and the shot of Rocket opening a door are part of the same sequence. Maybe Rocket needed something (weapons, tech, Ship?) from a safehouse he has set up and needed the Bifrost to get there. ",1
And not even 5  of the entire box office revenue. Just 5  of first dollar gross (opening night). Its no wonder that disney wants to get more than that out of the deal. Although I do agree that asking for 50/50 was a bit much. 30/70 sounded more reasonable but I guess we'll see what happens.,1

"Hello Kevin Feige. Thank you for doing this AM(A)A. In Endgame we see a lot of the characters with their classics suits from the comics, such as Iron Man with the Mark 85, wich is very similar to his original armor, Captain America with his 'scale' uniform and Rocket Racoon wearing his red and blue costume. The idea of 'saving' some classic costumes for Endgame was there since the beggining of the MCU?",1

Probably cleaning it after killing that guy on the ground.,1
They didn't have a stand up routine in the comics. And the movies don't follow the comics. I watched the trailer and Thanos had his own army. Didn't the same thing happen in Avengers 1 + 2? So they just fight armies. I just don't get the excitement.  ,0

"As much as I like the his. Thor 3 has the weakest story and the entire movie is inconsequential right after it ended it. It didn't have any emotion, just random scenes put together.

"I think the whole point of FFH was Peter being his own man and accepting that he was never going to be the next Iron Man.  And yes he did inherit some of the tech but let's face it how is a broke 16 year old going to make quality suits otherwise? Tony wqs still his mentor and taught him lots of things, and I like that as long as the next movie won't completely rely on that which I think will be the case.",1

It showed how to set up a genre and build a world, how to make sure you stay rooted in characters and motivations instead of getting chasing spectacle for the sake of it (and the prequels showed what happens if that goes wrong...) Basically I think Coppola and Scorsese are just sick of being asked for their opinion about these movies.",1

I read an article where they talked about how much Gyllenhaal loved the custom that he practically never took it off. The costume was built for practicality and to try and minimize CGI so I guess it s pretty comfortable over all. Normally they d have scenes where he would ve been in normal street clothes to make him more comfortable but he insisted on rocking that. That s gotta be an amazing compliment as a costume and effects person. Plus it adds to the character. I hope he stole a version.,3

We had Capt America, Iron man and Thor, now it's time for a new big 3, but since we're getting more franchises and maybe more readapted characters from comics, I hope we get  big 3s  for phases instead whole sagas. Galactus? Maestro? X-men vs the world? Secret wars? Some good Doom versus Strange",1

"I have never looked, but is there an example of how badly that could turn out for the actors if they were sued?  As I mentioned, they could all likely walk away and do something else with their lives, retiring with more than any of us will ever see in our lifetimes.  So what if Disney sued them for a few million when they have that and more in the bank?  Or is it more devastating than that? I know you likely don't have the answer or are privy to that exact information, just something I'm wondering about.",1

Meh. Good editing but it s just sensory overload,1
Sigh. That's what I mean. An unsourced rumour about what Feige *might* be doing. Those articles are a dime a dozen and nearly always wrong. Why do you even waste the time it takes to read them? Let alone take the leap from reading an obvious rumour with no source to  this is definitely the truth! ,2
I certainly like those movies too. I like Hitchcock and Michael Bay. Popcorn movies with shit that blows up and Ingmar Bergman films. I watched Shazam and Germany Year Zero the same night.,1
would have done what? i edit to fix typos because i don t want a caps lock character to leak through ,2

He's the same as in the Walking Dead but he talks a little less. Also the accent made me think of him more as a stereotypical right-wing redneck ex-military douchebag instead of a psychopath who happened to have a bad experience after the military.,0

"I think that s more interpretation and commentary on events than anything. Aside from what Mark himself is actually feeling, the timeline and facts add up.  Mark DID say on I believe Twitter that he wasn t on board with a new Star Wars film without Carrie and Harrison. So I imagine it sucked when Disney hands him a script where he never sees Han and the only scene with Leia there s like 3 lines of dialog. That would be a bummer for sure. ",0

Probably dees,1
This is exactly how I feel. Aquaman and Shazam have good reviews but I just have zero desire to watch them. I pretty much gave up on them after BvS. The only DC movie I saw after that was WW and I thought it was just ok.,1
The plot just seemed lame. No interesting turns just classic time travel and then a cliche big battle scene basically a rematch of IW and a lot of really corny stuff in-between. Some characters were overpowered. I just wasn't into it at all .  Even though i loved infinity war this one let me down. My girlfriend was done with it in like 30 minutes and I couldn't blame her lol.,1

So basically now the Russos drop anything and we're hyped. And they dropped the damn trailer on TWITTER,1
CAP SHAVED HIS BEARD WHAT,1
It's really cool their characters' in-universe relationship seems to reflect their real-life relationship.,2
this is the likely scenario tbh,0
">Taika Waititi, Edgar Wright, and Chris Miller all stood up for Gunn and refused to direct it. This is just amazing to hear. Camaraderie. They'd have just gone down the list until they hired  19 y/o film sophomore from private Christian University  to direct it ",1
Perfectly balance,1

Tony made it back to Earth.,1
But Thor has his hammer back?? Not storm breaker??,1
"IDK, looks like Bullseye to me.",3
The hair is a vast improvement homie lmao,1
"I personally think it could have benefitted from cutting a lot of story. The film was way too overstuffed, with unnecessary character development (we didn't need a Bruce/Nat love story) and there was so much quips that it feels like Joss had too much writing freedom. But it's still a good movie.",2
Marvel movies have been  Getting old  since GotG. Crazy that they keep blowing other movies out of the water though. ,1
They both have cleavage on display though.,1
It would be the perfect way to bring the symbiote into the universe. The new suit matches the black suit spider close enough as well. Would be a much better way to introduce Venom as well.,1

Yea in the original Maguire trilogy anyone that found out who Spidey was died lmao. After Vulture found out who Spidey was I thought oh snap he's gonna die. It was a very pleasant surprise that that wasn't the case,2

"judging by the prologue of thor and thor 2 and whatever, your average Asgardian's got 500-1000 years to them.",1
I love the way the parents were more excited,1
"Difference is thor has been a long standing character for the entire 10 years of the MCU, not to mention we also got build up towards the moment as we followed his journey throughout infinity war.  CM in contrast is barely apart of the movie, had one movie prior, and just... showed up.",3
You must know every movie in such intimate detail! Impressive.,1
Wow. I can't believe someone actually had the guts to say this. Normally this sub treats Endgame like the holy grail of movie making. Take an up vote for your ballsy-ness,2

"I just found it kind of slow really. The characters *looked* right, but it just wasn't exciting enough.",2
I mean if you follow the  scientific  reasoning behind how it works dont think this would work. The scentific explanation was that all it does was increase or reduce space between atoms so no weight would be added or lossed. So that tiny fleck of gold that is the size of a house still weighs a tiny fleck of gold But that was thrown out immediately considering the tank keychain doesn't weight a tank.,1
Ah whataboutism.... Great arguement.,0
Only half of the Iron Man mask. Oh man. ,1

YOU FOOL,1
Yeah I had them too... but they are more of 80s hold out than 90s. I'll give you Tamagotchie and maybe Bike shorts. But everything else is more 80's. Especially if we are talking mid-late 90s,2

"Regular Gamorra had no idea who Tony was because she was already kidnapped by the time the Guardians met him on Titan. This Gamorra was just probably conflicted about all of it, having only just turned on her own father for a short amount of time.",1
"Hi Kevin, congratulations on being the man to do what others have only dreamed about. You've forever changed the face of entertainment. My question is if there are any ideas you and the team have and love that could never come into fruition. That is, not ideas that need breathing room (I'm still praying for a proper MCU Symbiote saga someday), just things that are unimaginable even to you to adapt.",1
Its a reference to Civil War,3
"The canon s flow is a one-way direction.   The films exist in the TV show s continuity, but the TV shows do not exist in the films.  This is because the shows are handled by a totally separate company (Marvel Entertainment).",1

Unfunny jokes are still jokes. I m sure he doesn t actually mean what he said.,1

Meanwhile me and the boys are just shooting the shit and drinking beer together on weekends.",3
Cosmic Ghost Rider. Is there a chance we see him in the MCU? Thanks Kevin for everything you have done to make the MCU what it is today.,1

"True though, superhero movies are as disposable as their merchandise",0
"Fans often question whether or not currently existing TV shows produced by Marvel TV are canon to the MCU. Do Agents of SHIELD, Runaways, Daredevil exist in the same world as movie heroes?  Agents of SHIELD is one of my absolute favourite TV shows because of the outstanding character development for obscure and original heroes like Quake and Leopold Fitz. It matters a lot to me if this incredible fictional universe includes amazing characters like them.",3
"He s probably going to have a small but significant role in the film, he was the director for all three Iron Man films and really is what spawned the MCU after he started talking to Marvel people after being in Ben Affleck s Daredevil. If not for that awful movie we wouldn t have the MCU ",3

Are there any plans to use previously established characters like the leader in the future of the MCU? Also what is your personal favourite marvel film?,1
> HER CLASSIC LOOK Are you from the future,3
"Hi Mr Feige, really big fan of yours. My question is that if the X-Men are brought into the MCU will they still be played by the same actors? ( e.g. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.)  Thanks for all you ve done for the MCU, you ve really made it an amazing experience for all of us.",1
Galactus yooooo,3
"i think this is more of a celebration of the people behind the movies, and the actors that were there if they happen to be in the photo, great, but this is really about the people that make the magic happen behind the scenes, and yeah the photoshops arent great, but its the best way to aknowledge everyone",3

"Lol we all knew they would eventually come to an arrangement  More hyping of the Spidey movies, smart marketing",1
Now that they have an impossibility large amount of money and given that every new marvel movie makes huge sums and are taking more and more chances  pretty likely if that s the direction Scarlet want to go with it.,3

You know what I changed my mind, I looked up some clips to remind myself and Hammer is actually quite enjoyable.  But as I said Sam was still great, I just kinda wish they'd have given him a better role in a better MCU movie. Another edit: I think his jealousy of Tony Stark and him trying hard to be more like him and failing is what makes me uncomfortable. ",1
"Good call, missed that part, ty",1

"No one's arguing that the **early** movies have different settings and stories. The question was, are they the same genre? And the answer is yes. Iron Man's gritty opening, ironically enough here, feels more like Cap's second act. Ant-Man and beyond aren't early movies.",1

Shouldn't this be in imgur?,1
I agree with the sentiment and your opinion but I also think that a reason for them not including action sequences is that most of the action takes place all throughout time/the past and they do not want to reveal that info yet.,1

"See the above picture, its happening lol",1
"Iron Man has had 6 hours of screen time, the most of any MCU character. He doesn't need another movie.",1
"The alt right people who brought theee tweets to light didn t do so because they re offended by Gunn s jokes, they did it because they think he s a literal pedophile. It s an insane conspiracy theory bring pudhed by unhinged loons. ",1
"Are they right? Am I just old and out of touch? No, it's the children who are wrong!",3
"Agreeing that we all want things to be their best and there is no ill will, what advice would you give DC and their movies? Similarly to how you provided help with Sony s Amazing Spider-man series.",2
And why do you think the feminist movement started? Because that equality doesn't seem to exist in most social and economical fields.,3
"When Mjolnir flew to Thor and transition to it flew back to Cap, that gave me goosebumps. If anyone asked me the definition of epic, I'll show them your clip. Excellent clip.",3
You are a f****** genius...,1
"I, totally with you. It s so easy to troll people online that when someone says something nice it feels genuine.",1
Let's pump our brakes until it finally happens or  we  will end up ruining it somehow still.,0
"I don't think you should be downvoted here. This point is valid. Endgame is, speaking completely fairly, still way behind not only Avatar but many other films as well. I'm wondering why this point is being ignored.",0
"Ah, my bad. I didn't even know classic Fury had a movie.",1
"It s late, go to bed!",3
"Pretty much, yeah!",1
Wait the second is a total 4 and a half hours or it s an extra 4.5 hours making it 7.5 hours?,3
How is mjolnir back?,1
"The worst part is they try to give an explanation though, they say it reduces the distance between atoms but in that very same movie they go subatomic. If you can t stay consistent for one film just don t explain it at all.",1
Hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars will have that effect on people,2
*slams phone on ground* Another!,3
"Oh shit, man, I remembered that. Feels. ",1
Can't a woman change her haircolor without a whole years passing?,0
Not necessarily. I mean it wouldn't be hard to find someone shorter than 6 foot,2
Ant-Man 3 or Ant-Man and The Wasp 2? Or if they make a solo Wasp movie would we have Ant-Man and The Wasp and Ant-Man and The Wasp?,3
Best I can do is 5 ,1
Though it seemed like a part of his arc at the end of Civil War it seems like the Black Panther is kind of soft and watered down compared to his comic book counterpart in the films since Civil War. Any plans to get the character back to the roots? Smarter? More brutal?,1
I'm so far behind in these movies I had no idea that Jake Gybellenhill was even in any of them.,1
Please refrain from making me die of laughter in the middle of class again thanks,2
Micheal Keaton turned down the role of Jack in Lost because he doesn t wanna do a 6 season standard contract for a TV Show I wouldn t be surprised if Chadwick doesn t wanna commit to something thing that long considering he s star power is still growing and he could potentially be an Oscar worthy actor in a matter of years.,3
The hardest choices... require the strongest wills,1
The article says he saw an early cut. He must have not seen the terrible CGI fight scene at the end lol,3
"Not the same if half the world s farmers are gone (or more, given that the snap likely isn t granular in dividing groups of people), and crops are left to rot in fields or the food distribution system collapses without truck drivers or people to process the crops and refine plants into food. The world came together for a few weeks after 9/11, then we started invading Afghanistan and people started giving Arabs the side eye. I d except the level of distrust to continue even after something like the snap. ",2
But they rereleased a months old movie of course it will beat anything if you keep doing that...April s run and July s run are two separate things and neither beat avatar. This gimmick shit is dumb. Didn t Batman vs Superman do this?,0
I'm so freaking excited for this! ,1
Please be careful! My cousin had this and he lost his vision. ,1
You just did. In the trailer....,0
Thank you grammar police.,0
When was Shuri confirmed alive?,2
I thought it would have helped if they had shown that he could still get mad.  The new Professor Hulk never really had a moment where he got pissed off and powerful.  Or maybe Professor Hulk isn't supposed to get mad?  I don't know.  He just seemed far less powerful.,1
Hers were great as well for his birthday,1
 I did kinda miss his devil costume though and his baton,1
the marvel legends bio?,1
With help from a waste of parts,3
Thanos sends his regards,1
u/leunnam listen to this,1
Love that theme,2
"Did you ever imagine, at the beginning, that all of this would become so big? Culturally and story wise? As a fellow comic lover, I feel like it's almost needless to say... Thank you for everything.",1
"Unpopular opinion, but personally, I think Thanos is purple. ",3
You stole this meme,1
Finally they agreed!,1
I hated Shazam but that s six superheroes that could crossover without needing other films/heroes.,1
June,1
"Thor comes in, wrecks the place, goes toe to toe with Thanos and everybody cheered.     Captain Marvel comes in, wrecks the place, goes toe to toe with Thanos and everybody goes WTF?!?! impossibu!!",1
With Affleck out there s definitely a spot to fill,2
"Can someone tell Chris to not use white text on a black background again. It hurts my eyes. In all seriousness though, from what I've read, the tweets were bad, but mostly horribly out of context. If anything this is on Disney's head. You can't just ignore something you clearly knew about and then fire the guy when what you already knew about becomes a problem. ",1
"I knew he looked like someone and I just couldn t place it, thank you!",1
Would prefer Jeffrey Dean Morgan for that role.,2
What is your favourite marvel movie?,1
"The way her speech is written.  People with strong accents, including Boston accents, have their words spelled the way they pronounce them in comics.  Carol doesn't.  You can see the difference in the recent Life of Captain Marvel series, where Carol's family has their  er s spelled like  ah s the way they pronounce them but she doesn't.",2
It's almost like no one takes autists seriously who label someone a pedophile over a joke. It's also like we all know that Trump has been accused by multiple miss teen USA participants of walking around their dressing rooms while they were nude and underage. Hmmmmm,1
"Trailer 2 is always more hype, look at Civil War's second trailer compared to the first",1
"Hey Kevin, if you could do any duo superhero film which 2 heroes would it focus?",1
"Same, Spider-Man is my favorite superhero since forever and seeing such a good version of him next to other superheros in the movies just makes me happy",2
I expect the person who made The Godfather to not resort to childish insults about a movie series because lots of people like it. Especially when he still thinks that stupid fart in a can scene in Jack was funny.,0
"Thanks so much! But no, I'll just read through the thread after work.",2
You heard they used paint? I heard they used melted crayons and beets for the blood. ,1
"And for some reason if you're in the middle, Reddit sees you as a Libertarian and somehow worse?? Boggles the mind. We gotta be chill with each other. ",1
Is thanos missing a finger in that shot??,1
I have you now,1
"This subreddit's community is what every subreddit community should be. You guys are awesome. I'm really happy for Alexander. I'll think about him when I'll go see the movie, that's for sure.",3
"Forgive me, but how do you know it's him?",1
Hey!    I spotted Ant-man in this trailer!,1
"I can't wait for The Nerd Crew breakdown, either!",1
Cool. Can we call it  Thor Goes Fourth ? Or maybe  Thor goes Thorth ?,1
What photo?,2
"Both Guardians movies are the only MCU films I've shed tears over.  Vol. 3 wouldn't have been the same without Gunn. Thank you Gunn for handling the situation with dignity, class, and remorse. Thank you *GotG* cast and the other directors considered for Vol. 3 for standing in solidarity with him. And thank you Disney for both realizing and correcting your mistake.",2
Alone? Unlikely.,0
Worked for Dead Pool http://beta.ems.ladbiblegroup.com/s3/content/ef27e7415afe266be0c960db6868fb4a.png (url),3
"That s okay, I seem to have misinterpreted, it s sometimes hard to interpret tone from text. Sorry about that.",1
 It s Wakandan forcefield tech. You like it? ,1
And the father of both Hela and Fenrir.,1
Hi Kevin great too see  you here what is your favourite movie that you have made,1
Not getting an attitude at all. Just calling it like I see it. Hey you will always have 23 movies to rewatch and enjoy I guess whenever they get rereleased in theaters since you dont like watching things at home. The rest of us will enjoying all this sweet new content.,1
Why do you think dogs are known for peeing on fire hydrants? If they actually do it a lot why do you think that is?,1
Thor too.,1
I d watch that crossover,1
"I hope Clint gets the final kill shot on Thanos. I've been *that* guy who's favorite Marvel hero has always been Hawkeye, so this would be maximum me gusta for me.",3
"Why is nobody mentioning the fact that Disney is partly to blame for this? This isn t just Sony bad, Disney good it s more like Sony irritating, Disney greedy",2
"Doomsday can't really be in a ton of the movie, he can't fucking talk.",1
>negotiations are over wether Marvel Studios will make them or is Sony... going to fuck them up,1
I edited my comment. tldr  it's probably Nebula in the trailer.,1
*hype*,3
"probably plenty of them?  and if it wasn't this issue, they'd just find another one to get  horrified  about. hollywood will defend rapists and abusers to no end but god forbid a guy comes out as a conservative or Christian. ",0
The white Avengers suits were leaked late last year. That s the only one I knew about. ,2
"Torrents mate, Torrents",0
So true. The highest karma post i ever had was literally just a screen shot from GotG2 with an exciting title. ,3
"Why didn't Iron Man die while putting all the stones on? Immediately? Hulk screamed and moaned of pain and Thanos too, but Tony he just went straight to the snap. Why didn't he shout in pain?",1
*HERE COMES THE MONEYYYYYYYY*,1
I prefer the birthday suit,1
Sweet! Thanks.,1
You re a good egg,1
Will Miles Morales make an appearance in Far From Home??,1
" Asgard  Wakanda is not a place, it's a people",3
Give me a reason for why they cut it out.,0
Is it really Americas ass? /u/KevFeige,1
None taken.,1
"Thor wants to know your location... Oh, shoot he can already see you because of stormbreaker's bitfrost power  Edit: bifrost",3
"Timothy Olyphant was also in consideration apparently. I *love* RDJ, but I'd have also totally been up for Olyphant too.",2
"She probably would of eventually became lady thor anyway, even if there was no problem with her playing a damsel in the first place",1
Unfortunately we can t make it to SDCC this year :( hopefully next year though! ,2
I CAN'T STOP SHAKING. ,2
Rip arm,3
Clearly passed on social skills. Thats the rudest way to say you don't like something.,1
Multiple contusions detected,2
"had to look it up because I forgot it, and it's much better than I expected. Captain marvel is walking through a train, pulls down what he is reading to see who is reading it and it's stan lee, she just gives him a big smile and they go on their way.  after looking it up just now, he's reading a  mallrats  script and repeating  trust me, true believer . he had a cameo in the movie in 95, and said the phrase  trust me, true believer  in it.",3
Today extracts a heavy toll.,3
"Too late now, but I have one question: why?",1
TO FIGHT THE HORDE  SING AND CRY,3
Where's the OG thread,1
Freight Car,3
I like that The Incredible Hulk always gets the most simple superficial references lol.,1
Neither.  Should have chosen a different heroine altogether. Or just write her so shes not a useless whiny baby.,1
"They may have, I don't fully remember. And a lot of people missed it regardless.",1
 Did somebody say Baba Yaga (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16S8b2tko40)?,1
"Depends, are we talking Marvel Studios or Marvel source material? Because Dark Phoenix did NOT do well.",2
Faaaaaaaart. Watching actors act.,1
Unfortunately racism always will exist and claiming white privilege to be an issue in America is definitely not helping.,0
Man this is going to be so good.,3
He also has a post from 2 weeks ago that he has another year. Quite contradictory to what's claimed now.  It's a shame reddit has made me this sceptical. ,2
Isn't he Green Lantern though?,0
"Salamat, pogi",1
"Definitely not. The idea is they're killing the competition, not bringing these shows into the fold.",1
"Ohhhh ok, I was like I m pretty sure they never showed a snap victim. Thanks.",1
Its been Josh Brolin the entire time.,1
Haha wow. I was at +15 when I first posted it. Guess that took a swing :D,0
"Same here. And if I'm not mistaken, Black Adam appears first in most storylines anyway. So it would make sense chronologically.",1
I bet that moment where vision is on his back is a little bit of misdirection. And maybe even the color ofthe sky when Thanos shows up. Gonna watch this one at least ten times.,1
" Wonder Woman (https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba43677ba05a79671a3e0134611ab6ce.webp),   definitely Wonder Woman (https://fsmedia.imgix.net/3f/ac/bd/71/edc9/47df/a7eb/8f6908a9a70e/wonder-woman-lifting-thors-hammer-in-marvel-vs-dc-2-from-1996.jpeg?auto=format 2Ccompress dpr=2 w=650).",1
He seems to have mommy issues so maybe earth gives him anxiety.  ,1
"IMAX showing? Man what a bummer, I had tickets for me and a few friends for the 6pm IMAX showing on last Thursday night. Get there and we sit for an hour while they tried to get it to work. I m surprised the audience didn t riot cause of course that theater was packed FULL. But we all got 2 free passes so that helped the burn a little, but still super disappointing.",1
"Lol. Nice meme, cuck. That's all you've got? C'mon at least give me a good  reeeeeeeeeee! . Hahahahaha",0
in Edward Norton's basement,2
Awesome! I saw your previous two montages too. They all are pretty good!,1
Which song from all Marvel movies is your favourite? Mine is the good old Mr Blue Sky from Electric Light Orchestra. I'm right now listening to other songs of them  ),1
How does it get racked without your hand getting rekt?,1
>You tell a  super hero  dad he has a chance at resurrecting his lost child and he ll fight the whole marvel universe to see it done. FTFY.,1
Litterly noone cares. Noone. ,0
"Hey Kevin,quick question..Cap and Mjolnir?why this late??",1
"Last ever until Tony Stark from another dimension, played by a younger actor shows up.",1
"Why? Gunn made off color jokes a decade ago, and apologized for it. Roseanne and Allen have made openly racist/bigoted remarks very recently, and rather than owning up to it and apologizing, tried shifting the blame off of themselves. Gunn was specifically targeted by Trump cultists, and never would have been in trouble were it not for their active measures. No one needed to dig up dirt on Roseanne or Allen, because they did it to themselves.",2
Do you guys just put the word  quantum  in front of everything?,2
what? in what possible scenario would the original live? He clearly falls into tank of water,1
Oh god no I'm crying all over again,1
"That's always my first thought, too.",3
Loki's real mom lookin swole.,2
Which non-MCU film character would you like to put into the MCU if you could?,1
You're thinking of an Ostrich. Australia is that place they send extra criminals to.,1
I just woke up today and reading this literally made my eyes open up and heart rate go like crazy. Like what the FUUUUUUUCK,3
"After the MCU, what do you plan on doing? Will it be comic book-related, or are you going to do something completely different?",1
Ant Man gives Captain America hope....,1
Now we just need Disney to turn the 4k back on. It hasn't been working since day one. Updated the app and restarted everything related and still no 4k or 1080p. The highest I get is 720p on a hard wired 200+ Mbps connection.,1
Pretty sure the Ancient One was being a little flowery in her use of language in that scene. Timelines are created by any time travel into the past. Timeline creation isn't restricted to removing Infinity Stones from the past.,2
BRING ME u/alexander q *throws stormbreaker*,1
"So thats it huh, we're some kind of Avengers Infinity War",3
"I completely forgot about Shang-Chi and The Eternals. My brain has pretty much shut out anything past Endgame. Far From Home is still in there because we got a trailer, but I'm still not thinking about it",3
"I m sure Tony has all sorts of data on him in the avengers compound, he wasn t exactly secretive ",3
Paging u/Winter soulja,1
Bear Grylls is in this movie?,1
ARRRRRGH,2
"*Hits iron man* heh, just beat the devil outta it ",1
"So will you guys be doing a Fantastic Four origin movie, or are they going to come over from another universe? Or will you simply skip the origin like with Spider-Man?",2
"Hey Kevin!!! If you could pick one person in a perfect world to play Wolverine in the MCU, who would it be? Thank you for all your HARD work!",3
"Idk why any of them would leave tbh. It seems like a lot of fun, they can get paid better than they will anywhere else, the studio works around people s schedules like they did for cumberbatch during IW so they can still do more serious projects. The only reason I could think of is if hemsworth or Evans decide they don t want to have to maintain the harsh steroid, diet and workout regimens their roles entail, but they re still in their mid 30s. That didn t get to Hugh Jackmans breaking point till 50. ",1
He also died a few days after they left him on the island with May.,1
Why would people do that?  Because they disagree? Because they are major jerks?,1
I feel like it would more likely be inspired by the remains of the ultron sentries.,1
"Id imagine that at the end of venom Carnage is absorbed into Venom and now it's Venom but more evil. If Carnage ever reemerges Venom is more tame and his main purpose is like,  shit, I have to find him so he doesn't kill everyone.  and he won't let anyone stop him. Kind of like how in the current Carnage line Venom seperates from Eddie because Eddie wanted to save someone instead of killing Carnage so Venom leaves him and takes over the Hulk.",2
"While I loved Deadpool, I thought Deadpool 2 wasn t very good at all. To each their own.",1
"Oh shit, nice catch.",1
I never knew that I needed this until now. I Can t wait to brew the dead while snorting some on the side.,2
"Nope, sorry dude I read that in another comment earlier",1
"Thats it, Dr. Strange can be summoned as an Archer in Fate series.",1
Hey Kevin!  Huge fan and so grateful for what you ve done with the MCU.  What would you say is the most important part to maintaining the Marvel quality we ve come to expect across 22 films?,1
How annoyed are you that he signed the star upside down?,1
"Crazy prediction: Captain Marvel, Okoye, Ant-Man, and Banner will be the only survivors.",1
"I don't think it'll be a big part of BP though, I'm pretty certain that's where it is, but they won't make a big deal of it until IW.",2
That s definitely not Pok mon,1
I'm not entirely convinced that his wife wasn't actually  SPOILERS  by homelander and that she wasn't being forced to live in the burbs with the boy,2
"False, it s not suddenly just an addition of 40 pounds, the entire purpose of that was the show how depression had enveloped Thor. He spent 5 years wallowing in his own pity. He did nothing but drink, game, and eat poorly. I would most definitely say he was around half strength, although still noticeably strong he was nothing compared to his former self and it was very noticeable in how he dealt with 1 on 1 physical capabilities",1
Yes it is lol,1
"That s an entirely different Thanos with no stones, my image was referring to Infinity War Thanos that already had 4 gems at his disposal with prep time.",2
"And, somehow maybe involving an alternate time line, David Tennant as the Purple Man...",1
Aunt May: What the f-,2
He's a sweetheart. I've known him for a few years and he will do anything he can to help others.  ,1
I mean his snowball throwing ability is basically a super power.,3
You took *everything* from me!,3
No... it was two companies making an agreement. There was always going to be an agreement. It s just working out the terms. There was absolutely no way Sony wasn t going to go forward with a deal.,1
No pretty sure that's Burt Macklin,1
I'm honestly surprised he lasted as long as he did without her. This is such a lovely sentiment though.  3,2
Got em!,3
"And as far as we know, their mom didn't get blipped so I'm presuming given the extreme nature of the event, she would take over at least temporarily. There were other tribes represented and perhaps they elected an interim leader until a new permanent leader was chosen/elected. And Shuri was the latest head tech person in Wakanda, not the only one and not the first. She had to learn from someone and I'm sure they have a well funded and amazing educational system so someone most certainly filled the gap.",1
"Yeah, it's a shield. The Asgardian at the beginning (when you hear the emergency call) says  Shields are failing! ",1
"Damn, how did you keep the color themes so stylistically similar throughout? Combining films like ragnarok and gotg1 2, with their super bright colors, with films like Thor 1 and endgame and very dark colors, seems hard to me but you made it seamless! I especially noticed it in the shot with the hammer floating across the screen  was it just carefully picked shots or did you edit the color balance some?",1
Wow!!!! Absolutely brilliant,1
So cool they're pushing the original Avengers theme in here.,1
What incredible grace.,0
Thats exactly how they work,3
Also because he had no idea where most of these people came from because he didn't know a lot of them lol,1
That's huge man,1
teenage Groot hyyyyype,1
WTB Time Stone,1
This movie is going to be 4 hours long.  Can t wait. ,1
Inb4 someone makes Tony drifting in space a new meme relating to fans waiting for the trailer. ,1
Aw crap. Is he auditioning for Green Lantern again?,0
I really wish Logan would make an appearance. I don't care if it's not consistent with the timeline.,1
But that's cheap and lazy. I highly doubt anybody that dies is coming back through the time stone,1
A lot of people given the attention this post has gathered,1
"Black Widow is blonde, though.",1
"The MCU Spider-Man movies have both done the  cut to upbeat pop song after shocking development  so I can absolutely see a random New York bystander getting in the sole F-bomb after Deadpool teases it all film.   Then they smash cut to a Ramones song just as Deadpool is about to unleash a tirade, and the credits montage has Deadpool trying to fight his way out through the scenery and keeps getting papered over by doodles of the Spider-Man characters.",3
I don t think there will be a trailer 3,2
"Damn, i just gave away that im old",1
Well they can t all be Captain EO.,1
Wakawakaaaa,1
"Honestly, I thought Ready Player One's  Cavalry has arrived  was pretty cool. And imo it really was for a good year until Endgame. Sorry RPO, but you got one-upped.",3
Like how in Doctor Who way back when Rose ended up with a clone of the Doctor. It took away the tragedy and retroactively made an amazing (and heartbreaking) storyline pretty meh. ,1
I have to change my pants,1
"You're gonna shrink other people's property, while they might possibly be in it?",2
RIP Stan the Man we will miss u dearly,1
It's from actually looking it up like a competent person looking for knowledge does......you should try it sometime instead of being a cynical opinionated twat,0
0 white actors on the left ,1
Brie Larson better watch out,0
Lol no problems. And that's good! A DeviantArt for your writings wouldn't be bad either but Instagram is good for more  instant  exposure. ,1
Tom Holland just put the scene of Leo telling everyone  I'm Not Fucking Leaving  on his Instagram and it is the happiest I've ever been from an IG post,1
"I love how different this looks.  If I came in uninitiated, I could be convinced that this was a different studio, having a different hero in a different shared universe. Phase 4 is really going to be interesting!",2
What are some of the characters/teams you're most excited about bringing into the MCU and has there been any talks about this characters before? Also what's your favorite MCU movie to date?,0
Autizard?,1
"I'm not saying it's defensible, I'm saying the issue is being politicized and him talking about raping kids with a known kid rapist is something he has to deal with. My point is that people are taking it to extremes like him being tried for pedophilia or something lmao, when in reality if you look at the situation, the hypothetical extremes are just clouding judgment",1
yo wat the fuck,2
"It felt confusing to say the least, looks great but confusing. But still my man Phil Coulson is back on the big screen.",1
" Ned, who's Ned? We don't do character development beyond the 3 or 4 main roles. I'm just an extra that got lucky with a few lines. ",1
Rip Stan Lee you've earned it :(,1
Oh Dip! The Rousseau Brothers! ,2
Top right looks so much like a Halo elite.  It's the crossover I've always wanted!,2
yeeah but they're kinda douchebags so maybe he'd be ok with killing half of them,3
It would make sense because Ned has that line in the trailer about remembering when he first fell in love.,1
"Your friend s dead and Thanos isn t, because Thanos had armour and a big fucking gauntlet.",2
Reading all the questions about Marvel TV  ,1
Dr. Watched The Movie And also Dr. Not-appearing-in-this-film,1
"As much as I'm expecting the appearance in  one future Marvel Studios film  to be Avengers 5, what if its Sinister Six? Revolving around the team with Spider-Man as a featured opposer or something. Maybe its too much of a loophole.   If this is as far as the deal ever goes, maybe Marvel won't hold back and build to Sinister Six, instead featuring them in Spider-Man 3",1
Ad markers: 6,3
"That looks like she's touching black widow's shoulder based on the costume, not Tony's. ",1
"The  A  in the logo actually stood for  April  all along.  I just wish they didn't ruin that reveal in the trailer, but whatever.",2
Remember hulk on wakanda in IW trailer. They could be pulling something like that here. What if it's not Tony in that scene? It could be anyone.. even Thanos! Let that sink in for a minute,1
"I thought I was browsing through my feed instesd of popular and I was like, That's not Kenny.",1
roddy piper would piledrive that lady.,1
"So salty, you sure you're not from the DC universe?",1
Excuse my lack of proper articulation: *AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*,1
How would that have happened though?,1
Movie or trailer?  Where? ,1
>other characters wouldn't put themselves as far on the line as he does  3 Remember iron man in avengers 1? ,2
Threw me off for a moment.,1
I ll do you one better *why* is noobmaster69?,2

Keep us informed!,1
"And look at the numbers after spiderman joined MCU. Like I said it could have been a lot more than 500m, if they made that much with a lesser known superhero, I would totally agree they did amazing. That number with spiderman is not so impressive IMO.",0
I can think of another video game property based on Indiana Jones turned into movie that did... mildly.,2
I have a hunch Ghost and Goliath helped him got out. I remembered he was trying to get a particle for Ghost.,1
"Yeah I made the same mistake, I ordered 2 large fries for my gf and me the first time. Turns out we both could ve eaten enough fries with just 1 medium size.",1
How does  the snap  affected the SHIELD continuity? Are they going to appear on any upcoming film?,1
Just another dinosaur that s jealous of the MCU s success and their failure to remain relevant.  No different than Jennifer Aniston bitching about the MCU,0
Sounds like we might see spidey pop up in the venom movies!,1
Or just tell us.,3
God yes!  Awesome,1
She s shooting lasers from her hand **PEW PEW**,1
That s your subjective opinion. I d rather have no Cap than anyone else touching that shield.,1

Every day it seems more and more likely Gunn will return.,2
Who s scruffy-looking?,3
Discovering there are other worlds with beings capable of city levelling power sounds like good motivation to keep doing his job and prepare earth for whatever may come from the skies,1
dont know if you can answer this but do you have plans to bring the Xmen or any other properties into phase 4 or would that be in phase 5 or 6?,1
You can't see the actors emotion with a mask on,1
Maybe use something to level the pieces around the armor. Great job though.,1
What was it like working on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films?,1
"Haven't watched it yet but I'm surprised it's called  Official Trailer  just like the first trailer, no  2 or anything. Interesting. ",1
I love that series so much,2
Too safe is a good way to describe it,3
I'd say probably at a higher level than either. The only reason he's not Disney is because Disney got the right medium to profit from. Marvel has more original stories. Guess it doesn't matter now that Disney bought them.,1
"Hey..! Come on, man.",2
If they have Stan as a Watcher fixing the entire MCU that would be the most epic send off ever.  RIP.,2
Thanks random redditor,1

"Title it  Budapest . Make it a super spy, James Bond style movie with marvel flair with her and Hawkeye as the protagonists. Tons of great great villains to choose from. If they are going to make a Widow movie, I see that as the only real route. It would give the references to Budapest weight + we would get to see why Widow is so untrustworthy and see a more brutal Hawkeye. To top it off  make it the first R rated movie in the MCU. Kids aren t huge fans of Widow so they don t really need to sell toys.",3

"Do you (or anyone, really) have a source on him not getting to film with anyone? I've seen this thrown around a lot and I'm having trouble finding a source.",1
Ooh! Projection of emotion! Noice.  But I do like that Trump-esque  sad . ,1
"Dear God, the Genwunners of the MCU fandom: The Phasewunners.",3

That s legit,3
Angry analysis ,1
Hey comrade (      ),3
Poor kid she is too young (11? 12?) to being bitter against his father,2
"You know what's funny, though? Replace the  my rematch is coming real soon  bit with  Hulk dabs in front of some children  and it suddenly becomes even more unbelievable, but that one actually happened...",3
"He tweeted he wants to molest children, are you a moron?",0
"You dont get to decide if it should be shared - especially since it was a commissioned piece of art that people had designed and tattoo d on themselves. It s extremely short sighted and arrogant to think you are entitled to participate or share this design. Imagine you got a design tattoo d on you with close friends and family, someone liked it and decided they would start selling it? I think you should probably rethink your stance and comment a bit.",1
So how's it work and can it still be used in ways such as in this scenario?,1
"Glad this was cut, way too cheesy",1
I really wanted one where Odin woke up in the old folks home and then just went along with everything till Thor and Loki showed up,2
All my friends thing Guardians 2 is one of the best marvel movies.,1
The answer is probably yes. He worked on the first X-Men movies and the crew was blown away by his encyclopedic knowledge of the X-Men and Marvel in general.,2
"Don't look up QAnon, then. You'll get real sad real fast.",2
good bot.,2
"amazing, now do Dr. Strange in Tony Stark. I mean... what?",1
There's at least 10 people here,1
How many more trailers can Disney churn out before going out of business???,0
I'm just taking this as the official announcement from Marvel that Captain America will be shaven clean again by the end of the film.,1
Yay!! This is so exciting.,1
"Also, who is your favorite Avenger?",0
">Care to give any examples ? Nah. If ya can t see it, you re too far down the rabbit hole already ",1
Epic. Got chills at the end with her Thor-esque power up. ,1
"i kind of agree. If Taskmaster wasn't involved, i probably wouldn't even go see it, and i have seen every MCU movie i theaters.",0
Wow Awesome Job. That was some undertaking. You totally nailed it despite the time it took!,1
"Hey, you're entitled to your opinion. I do admire Lee's attempt to do something unique but unique doesn't always equal entertaining. As uninteresting as TIH was, it *was* trying to do something different help introduce a true cinematic universe. And frankly, I find the extended nature sequences in Lee's Hulk rather boring.",2
Ant man's role in this one must be pretty small  ),2
It s possible. Extremely unlikely. But Disney would have to pay Sony a truckload for their streaming rights once they expire. I think in the US their movies go on Starz right now.,3
10 years murder free!  Do.. do i get a coin or something?,3
"True, but they need to give us something about which to be excited. I'm way more excited about the returning supporting characters than anything else from this trailer. ",1
The Ultimate universe was everyone's low point.,2
"Spider-Ham, maybe.",2
u/Joe-Russo  u/Anthony-Russo u/Marvel-Official Let s try to make this happen. I m sorry my child. Life ain t fair,1
"Bucky (post mind control): Alright, put the serum in. The. Bag. Put it in!",2
I'm really sad about Runaways. I know it wasn't perfect but to me it was the best. I hope Disney does something with all these great cancelled shows.,3
"still..who gives a shit, no need to look like Jane Fonda (looks like it was put like that on purpose too)",1
"Interesting list. I wouldn t have put Mother! Or Midsommar on there. I liked Midsommar for being different, I felt like Mother! was pretentious. Also, loved Dunkirk and The Revenant but they seem high to me.  Mad Max Fury Road is incredibly well made but again, way too high for me at least. Top 100s are hard, but Scott Pilgrim, Three Billboards, Sorry To Bother You, Arrival could ve all been on this list. (Maybe I missed em) Love seeing Green Room on there.",3
Could be Okoye is in charge. The Dora Milaje are pretty prestigious after all.,1
She s literally my favorite character who s been treated like shit,0
We were definitely jinxed by u/Menace117 www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9w92cp/who is surprisingly still alive/e9iwv2r/?st=joeowgfq sh=be1ad1a8 ,3
So it's younger Cap from past?,1
Didn't Nebula bring everyone back when she took the Gauntlet when Thanos left his body and became a cosmic entity? They tricked her into undoing everything that had happened because she had no clue wtf she was doing when she had the power of the Gauntlet.,1
Omg. Hawkeye. Ant Man. A crying Cap. This is going to be epic. ,1
I started to tear up at the beginning but then it cut to Thor and his motherfucking braided beard ,0
who are you to question God's plan? maybe the OP is Nu-Hitler?,0
"Hey, cool! They did it.",1
"What makes you think that they aren' t already doing it? It' s obvius that, now that they have this possibility, the studios will try to get this thing right. The only factor that limits a human mind is fantasy, you can make everything work, as long as it' s well written.",1
"That's what a trailer should be IMO. An appetizer. Too many movies these days narrate most of the plot while they give away all the best action shots. By the time you watch the movie, you've already seen 70  of it in the form of TV spots and screen caps. Go watch the original  Alien  trailer on YouTube, you'll see what I mean. It's a sales pitch, not a  try before you buy .",2
Nah they're less likely to kill him off since he has transformed into Nomad,1
Le fuck :(,1
I felt the hair on my arms raising just like Peter LOL GOOSEBUMPS DAMN YOU MARVEL HOW DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS TO US we are thankful huhuhu,1
"Fucking Scott Lang. Every person he loves is turned to dust, and while the rest of the survivors are moping around he's still a lovable goof.",1
If they had Tony would have lost his daughter. He was very clear that they couldn't do that.,1
Marvel could get away with this name no problem,1
I know! Do we get a new team or do we get to keep Deadpool???,1
"Link where the directors said that. I'm not misinterpreting, the directors said specifically that they are going back in their own past, and changes to the past create alternate future timelines. Cap uses the mind stone on himself, whatever he did would be just stopping the creation of an alternate future.",1
r/punpetrol you are under arrest! ,1
Yeah things got bad fast.,3
It would have sucked having a film that was basically filler but it would have been damn good filler,3
Stanley as Rhodey is hilarious,1
Not a good scene so glad it was cut. Kind of cringe worthy with everyone going down one by one.,1
"Works both ways. My grandmother was as fit as a fiddle even at 83, we all assumed she would live until she was 100. But she didn't make it a year after my grandfather died.",2
Inb4 this Thanos can actually uses mental skills and fuck up Strange even more,1
"I want Latin hero in a big budget MCU film, not a cheap looking series.",0
"Hi Kevin! Thanks for doing this AMA.  The world has changed a lot from the time of the MCU s creation and the MCU has taken such an important cultural role.  I was wondering about how, considering   its uniquely influential position, the next phase of the MCU will embrace this new context, where diverse representation and a deep focus on and dedication towards social justice and equity are incredibly important?",1
I don t care at all what critics or marvel diehards that love everything they put out have to say. I think the movie formula is tired since they ve made the same movie maybe 20 times. Something refreshing is needed to keep the attention of viewers outside of their wheelhouse.,1
> guy who played the Judge. Fred Gwynne. He was also Herman Munster.,1
"I somehow didn't expect a fourth Thor movie. I am not complaining, as long as it is as fun as the third one.",1
I want to see this with Any Given Day's- Ignite the Light playing during it. Editied so the hammer hits right when the lyrics do.,1
Yeah they should have just given dd all 14 seasons if they had a contract like that.  ,2
"I mean- the answer is yes, the  final  alternate timeline would not have experienced the events of endgame, just like how the change to the 2014 timeline (killing Thanos) would have stopped the events of infinity war.",1
This whole thread in insane. I can't believe there are no people who've designed things with product life incorporated into it. This whole thread is nuts.,2
"Hold my vape pen, I'm going in",2
"I don't remember the Sony-MCU deal. Can you explain? Also, how does Sony, MCU, and Disney all play into what you're talking about? I'm very out of the loop on what parts they all play in Spider-Man.",1
"Hey, what other movies or media (besides the comics)  have influenced your vision for the MCU? Do you have a particular director/producer/artist etc that you have drawn inspiration from?",1
Yeah and Cap basically only had 2 solo films (Civil War as much an Avengers movie as it is a Captain America Movie),1
"Yeah. I don't understand the comment either. It might be a Reddit inside joke, and thus why is has so many votes.",0
"Ah, now THERE'S a good bot! A bot that hasn't been trained to understand humor yet, but even Data had trouble with that, so, it's fine.",3
"I trust the MCU is capable of displaying more mature themes in the movies to come. Blade might be rated-r and Deadpool will 100  be. Moon Knight will also probably be pretty dark.  I trust them to maintain DD s tone, maybe water it down a little for his movie appearances. But if they give him a show I think he ll be fine.",3

"Man I really gotta disagree. I think they did a pretty bad job of what an out of shape thor would look like. The biggest give away to me personally is the the pecs look weird as hell, and the belly is pretty unnatural.

ITS THE NEW TARMAC SEQUENCE!,1
Spider Verse beats most superhero movies by a landslide,1
"This is an understatement, but the ocean is big. With a bit of pseudoscience, there are multiple ways of introducing a hitherto unknown aquatic civilization that obeys the logic of the setting.  It's more unbelievable that two traditionally isolationist countries that don't share a border or historical/cultural ties would become aware of each other and go to war within the duration of a two hour movie.",2

damn that is one big forehead,1
"Libertarian conservative here and I do not agree with this firing. The comments were many years ago, from an artist who was known for being a provocateur. Context and knowing that these people are artists is important to keep in mind. They are not who you should look up to and emulate. They are fallible and dynamic personalities. Stop the mob justice. ",1
"it felt good personally, as someone who has experienced panic attacks, to see one of my favorite characters go through the same thing. ai too, agree that the way they handled it helped to address the issue rather than make fun of it, which i really appreciate. all of the Iron man movies are good in my opinion, but 3 is definitely one of my tops (along with iron man 1)",1

But it s still a flaw marvel has not Waititi,1
The fact that this article was made makes me think Disney and Marvel are using Disney+ viewings to decide if they bring it back. Especially since pretty much everyone involved has expressed a desire to bring it back. I'm streaming it for sure. Again.,2
Hey! What was it like working with/coordinating so many actors and timelines into one place over many years? Thanks! :),1

It s ok. You can rest now. You did it.,3
"Yeah that is Loki in a nutshell. The thing is with Loki is that he yearns to rule. If Thanos rules or more likely, wipes out everything in his path, there'll be nothing left to rule. A self-serving Loki simply cannot serve Thanos and ever realise his own ambitions. He might hand over the Tesseract, but only in an attempt to stave off further loss.",2
"I by no means am a super hero movie fanboy, but I can t even fucking lie and say this trailer didn t make me so hyped for it. Loved infinity war, this one will be equally as good, if not better. ",1
Why wasn't that keep in,1
I didn t even realize when it played the teaser that it was of End Game. Halfway through I realized shit its epic ,0

His pg porn series was really unfunny, even at the time.  I'm not sure what your basing him being a good director off of, really. ",1

"In what world do you see Disney suing the likes of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and the rest of the crew over the firing of a director because of tweets from years ago. Disney would never let it get that far. They would just rehire Gunn if the cast was that serious. The PR from making Disney look like assholes for suing their actors would be huge and would absolutely hinder their Fox deal as it would show what can happen if Disney gets too much control.",1

This is really nice to have considering I was sobbing through this scene in the theater and didn't really get a great look at them together.,1
"Hello Kevin, hope you re well.  What fan theory/ies did you enjoy reading the most? Which theories do you think would look best when played out on the big screen? And thanks again for the past 11 years, they ve been a blast!",1
"True he was originally, but in 2002 he was redesigned to look like Sam Jackson and has been like that since",1
At least!,1
He's like the new Harry Potter,3

I just don't like how it'll sound in Spanish...  los Vengadores: El Juego Final ,1
"Is that still the case? That *was* the case when they had Heimdall s rainbow cannon, but with Stormbreaker, theoretically, shouldn t Thor be able to summon the bifrost anywhere? Isn t whatever curse that limited the bifrost to the nine realms lifted, since the destruction of Asgard? I don t think it s certain.",1
Fantastic news!! Yay!!,1
Gemma Chan is in Eternals. Does that makes Captain Marvel non-canon now too?,3
"Man, a month is still too long of a time to predict for a man in your condition... If you're not getting early screening, you better not die suddenly. I don't need to be sad over your death while I'm crying over Stan and Cap on the 25th.",1

The first thing I noticed when I saw the scene.,1
So happy they got in touch with you and that it s actually happening. Hopefully you enjoy the movie! ,1
"Funny you mention that, have you visited r/fantheories recently? I forget exactly what they were saying, but the gist of it is that we probably didn't get the best outcome. It was like 3rd or 4th down the line. You should check it out.",1
" Cap, who never takes his eyes off Thor.   )",1
Yes. I m sure that s exactly how it is. Endgame is gonna be absolutely mind numbingly good. ,2
"Is it just me or was Tony the only one who didn't speak in the intro? I mean, it's Nick Fury's voice when he's shown.",3

It's Thor. You can tell by his guns.,1
What? It's funny. ,0
"This is wonderful. I can hear those lines being spoken in my head, too!",1
He also played Bright in Everwood! Man I loved that show,1
"Hey Kevin thank you for all the amazing work you have done! My question is: how do you pick the film makers who work on the movies? Compared to many other studio Marvel tends to work with many smaller filmmakers and I am just curious how the choice is made, especially considering many of these film makers never worked on a movie with such a scale.",1
"I kinda wish we saw this, even if in a flashback to when he was younger and more violent.",1
"We need cooled blankets snd pillows. They could just pump a cool solution through them when they detect that too hot temperature, and bring it down to the  cool other side of the pillow  temperature. Sigh, at least its cooling down here now. This summer was brutal. Might have had my first 50C day this summer",1

That trailer made me ugly cry! Ugh. Sooo good.,1

When will the phase 4 plan for marvel be announced?,1
"The 30-year old guy who looks like a sculpted Calvin Klein underwear model.. but is still pretending to be an awkward social outcast. I liked Garfield as a quippy Spidey, but he was just the polar opposite of everything Peter Parker is supposed to be.  ",3
Is Phase 4  Secret Wars  the perfect way to introduce FF   X-Men?,1
"I never had considered that, but this makes so much sense.",3

Back then Travolta wasn't so much a joke. He could've pulled it off acting wise but I don't think he could've looked the part.,2
"I completely bought CGI Fury.  Coulson looked a bit too plastic, though.",1
The die is cast!,1
"honestly, the VFX in infinity war are some of the best uses of cgi ive ever seen. there's an example i saw of when thanos gets the soul stone, and hes on the bare orange background, and you can still tell hes really big, without anything to compare him to",3
Looks like the Breton Hero from Elder Scrolls Online,1
Stormbreaker doesn t have the same enchantment as Mj lnir. Also if that was true then that means thor was blatantly lying to the GoTG s faces when he said they wouldn t be able to handle stormbreaker,1

I do not care about the cosmic side of the MCU. I cared for Daredevil and Punisher more than Guardian of the Galaxy.,1
But your argument lies on they knew what they were hiring when they hired him.  That same argument could be used for Roseanne.  ,1
Do they do that to make the fake punches/action look even *more* authentic? (About the frame rate lowering),1
Now im crying again. Shit!,1
This is great news! Adam Warlock bay-bay! ,1
Yep. They might face some backlash initially but they have so much power they can weather whatever storm that might cause and still come out ahead with relative ease.,1
This was absolutely beautiful,1
"Yeah, I just double-checked and he is. Don't know why I thought he was 5 foot 7.",2
"Kinda, the trailer still makes sense if you havent seen ant man 2. but I would certainly try to see it at some point because it introduces stuff that is almost certainly going to have a big part in avengers. ",1

"Same, I got goosebumps with that ending title reveal and the goddamn Avengers music. Give me this movie already, the hype is unreal.",1
Yeah but why would you think they d just explain that in the teaser trailer? It s unrealistic. They ll probably answer it at the end of the movie or in an after credit scene. ,1
Love me some Tosh!,1
Was that the guy who gave up and complained about the job?,1
He has at least two friends who owe him favours and are richer than God.,1
That hat is the worst one you could have ever had made ever.  So many other styles lol,1
Marvel/Disney is going to be in for a shock when they realize that fracturing the market is not really a great plan and piracy is going to be on the rise yet again due to influx of too many companies vying for subscriptions. ,3

That's actually an awesome idea!! I may do this  ,1
"This is true, HOWEVER Marvels content is always really good quality. They always have really solid casting, fantastic visuals and do a great job and blending source material with original concepts. Also they do a great job at taking lesser or unknown material and making it popular. And dont get me wrong I'm definitely a marvel fanboy but I also love both DC and Marvel and movies as a whole. Marvels got their shit together. And yes if they logo is on it and Feige is involved, I'll be there.",1
Snap her fingers.,1
"Any credible dictionary. The usage up to 1600 was the execution of 1 in 10, by lot. In 1660, it began to be used in its modern form, as a great culling. The thing is, the original never meant the loss of a great or major fraction of a population. For it to take this new meaning, it could ONLY come about from misuse. People mistook it to mean  to reduce to 10 , not reduce by 10 .",1
Sounds like he maybe has a problem with disney... and didnt they take away his precious daughter's Little Mermaid remake?,1
It s fuckin scary,2
"Yeah it's much more subtle than people want to believe. They expected him to have Hulk's voice and Banner's brain, which is usually the case in cartoons when this is done, but I liked the way they did it. It was just gruffier Banner voice.",3
I love that idea. Only issue is that COD tried something similar by live tweeting a terrorist act that never actually happened to promote one of the Black Ops games and it backfired extremely hard. ,3
I'd hate it.  Never read the comics either. But I like the  adult  hero movie.  Might as well take away the gratuitous bloodshed too.,1
"This post was somewhere in the top 30 or so of r/all so that's where I saw it. I remember his cameos but the last one I saw feels like 4 or 5 years ago, if a marvel movie even came out around then. Might have been Thor.",1
He could be a different version of Peter Parker just played by the same actor. Or the Sony stuff is gonna be vaguely mcu connected. Who knows right now,1

If Spider-Man 4 happens under an agreement between the studios, it will be July 2023 but that will bump whatever Marvel Studios has planned.",1
Where can I read them? I did for the first Avengers and a few other movies but I can't really remember where I read them ,2
I hope he's in it a lot and they're just downplaying it for fun. Same with Chris Pratt saying Star Lord is just a cameo. ,3
Who gilds this shit,0
Though keep in mind they'll prob drop the whole BUCy/Bucky aspect of his character and just call him Battlestar/Lemar Hoskins. They changed his name from Bucky in the comics to Battlestar when the writers found out Bucky was a derogatory term used for slaves before the Civil War.,3

Absolutely. It was clear it was a dumb move. And losing Gunn would only hurt Disney and GOTG3.  Ultimately he wasn't going to be punished if DC was willing to give him the reigns and a ton of money to direct their movie,3
I doubt it will be an horror movie. Probably a 2 or 3 scarry or disturbing scenes and that's it xd,1

I love this answer and couldn't agree more.  Fatigue comes from feelings of sameness.  Marvel has such a wide array of unique characters to choose from so there's no reason it has to feel the same!,2

"There are discernible differences, but they're not quantifiable in a way that you can numerically compare them to one another. You cannot say  Spiderverse is 45  art and GwtW is 89  art .

The craftsmanship and choice of ingredients is far more important than the type of food it is, and suggesting one is inherently inferior to the other because of its popularity is at best classist and at worst pretty much bigoted.",1

They mentioned that thanos is coming in season 5? So I think it s still technically canon. Although the whole introduction of inhumans and stuff would ve been a bigger player in the movies if it was truly canon.,3

"No, this cant be true. Chalie Cox made as much as RDJ, Chris Evans or C.Hemsworth to bring the MCU where it is now. This man deserves more respect than a simple cancellation of his show. This is the first time Marvel/Disney is disappointing me in 10years. If they dont change their mind, give at least, one last episode for him to say good bye. ",1

Hi Kevin! Obviously a huge fan like everyone here!!  Congrats on the success and providing all of us hours of awesome entertainment!

You're both right. It's easy to post spoilers and it's just as easy to learn major spoilers long before the release.  I think the real reason is due to their hiring process / filmmaking culture and that no one would believe spoilers without credible proof which makes it too risky.,1
This hit hard  ,1
like Dr. Who,1
"It's cute and fun with making the kid in Iron Man 2 Peter Parker (not official MCU canon but definitely in my head canon) but I don't think it adds anything to any story to make that kid Alexander Pierce, a character that died in 2014.  That's like going back to a series of wizarding books you wrote and deciding to change certain characters sexual orientation just for sticks and giggles.",2

"Well, I guess we're in the endgame now... Seriously. This is the kind of trailer that's perfect. There is JUST enough here for maximum hype without giving too much away. Heavy emotion from Tony, optimism for a good end from cap and widow, what looks like absolute badassery from Hawkeye, a glimpse of farmer Thanos, and, of course, some truly great humor from Ant-Man. Excited as hell!!",2

In the MCU there are no streaming wars. The influx of superheroes and aliens made cable news so important that it slowed down the move away from cable TV. Netflix was still sending CDs in the mail when The Snap happened and the entertainment industry was decimated. In the theatres of the MCU there is nothing like the MCU. There might be superhero movies but nothing is making a billion dollars. The biggest movies in the world turn out to be true stories about surviving the Snap and musicals.,2
"Lol what? They ve made billions from Spider-Man on their own. Disney is being greedy, Sony literally is fully in the right",1
I understand that there weren t exactly high expectations for Iron Man. At what point did you realize how big the MCU would become?,1
She just punched Memaw!,1
In a solo movie he'd be boring as a side character he can still change. Will he be more support now with his broken arm? will he use tech in addition to his strength? will he fight with one arm? will he fix his arm? will a major event cause him to lose his shit? He's stable now but his monstrous strength shows when he's angry. He's also not as adept at using his strength.,1

"Obviously it all turned out great, but still to this day I find that many people were not into Captain America based off of his first film. They obviously grew to like him over time and exposure, but I wonder if it was made today if they would make the same calls.",1
"The writers and directors have already answered this question in multiple interviews. This wasn't a sudden change in the character. Cap has been slowly learning to put his own interests ahead of his natural tendency to self sacrifice over the course of many movies. It's his character arc, it's a mirror image of Tony's arc, and it doesn't make him any less a hero.",3
I really loved it.  Where s Dr. Strange?   He s five blocks away. He won t begin his true journey for another few years  or whatever she said. She knew she d come to him,3
"Ah well, since I don't watch it anyway, it does not matter. As long as those who do, enjoy themselves, all is well I suppose. ",2
Were there any characters that you wanted to add to Endgame that weren t able to be on the big screen for one reason or another? Who is your favorite MCU character? Who is your favorite comic character?,1
This made me laugh real good,1
"Okay but regardless of whether that was a character decision or just a creative decision: Those are all dynamics that didn't HAVE to exist, but do. And far too prematurely for a high schooler Spider-Man in my opinion. I know this sub will never ever empathize with my opinion on this though, so I'm just gonna stop arguing.",2

"She won a freaking Best Actress Oscar before this in Room.  AND she played Amy Schumer s sister in the huge hit, Trainwreck.  She was in Scott Pilgrim (with Chris Evans).  She was one of the stars of Kong: Skull Island.  And on a personal note, I had followed her career since she played Nick Kroll s au pair, who wanted a Golden Gate from Pete and Rafi, on The League.   If you didn t know who she was, it s on you.",3

How are people still asking this question?,3
Adorable I tells ya.,1
I think the most amazing thing about this trailer and the ones before it is that Marvel has us incredibly hyped and it doesn t look like they ve showed any footage of anything that s more than 30 minutes in. ,1
"She's essentially a mutant right? Like Thor is an alien, Hulk got made, Tony, Rhodes, Hawkeye, and widow are just really really elite humans in their own skillset but Wanda has actual superpowers as a human  fitting into the mutant/metahuman category.  You just add a flashback with them trying to exploit/activate the x Gene back before the age of Ultron opening scene and boom... Mutants!",1

 Avengers Assemble  is there too,2
I personally don't like her acting and thought her character the weakest in the mcu. I also don't pay attention to the noise outside of the movies. Maybe if we get to see her more they can flesh out her character and everything will be good. Took a while for Thor to grow on me and he's my favorite.,3

The color on the flashbacks! SO COOL,1
I rewatched that movie pretty recently and I might be biased because I've grown so attached to these characters but it didn't seem as bad as I remembered. I liked the whole dying Tony thing and Mickey Rourke did a good job. Justin Hammer is probably what I liked the least about the movie which is a shame because Sam Rockwell is really good. They kinda squandered him. ,3

"The worthiness spell wasn't even put in until the first act of the first Thor movie, the one where he has bleached eyebrows. I don't think it was a case of 'Hela is also worthy, but not in the way you think.' Nor is it 'the hammer remembers her'.  It was just she's too damned powerful. Remember she took Thor's largest lightning blast without so much as a scratch, and even after he found his inner Led Zep, she was still stronger than him.",3

"It's back from the first Avengers when Loki gets away and Coulson dies and everyone hates each other. Fury is trying to give them something to come together over and he begins his spiel about how he had the idea to create a team to fight the battles that nobody else could. Tony is a little more in the know on The Avengers Initiative than anybody else at that point, so Fury says,  There was an idea -- Stark knows this -- called the Avengers Initiative. ",1
"No question here, I ll leave that to the professionals, just want to say thank you for your service and Endgame is the most ambitious and well achieved film of our time. You re the fucking MAN.",1

"Hey Kevin,    When Marvel first announced a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, it surprised a lot of people since there were more popular Marvel properties that did not have a film yet.

"Even when the show actors in the mcu were not invited in tenth year mcu anniversary they continued to rationalize it as marvel studio exclusive event without thinking that Feige probably thinks mcu is exclusive marvel studios. And then in their video as they discussed the mcu, none of them mentioned that the tv shows were also part of mcu.I meant how desperate can you be to be part of mcu when the mcu grandmaster can't even acknowledge your existence.",2

"Yes, I have read the tweets. I dont recall saying they were funny, can you point me to that part in my post? All I'm saying is they were meant as jokes. Gunn isn't the first person to use dark or shock humor, and he won't be the last either. South Park, for example, thrives off of it. Show me proof Gunn is a pedophile and I will agree with you, until then, shut the hell up over some damn jokes. ",2

"Hello Kevin and welcome,  Lots of people including me thinks that it was the prime of superhero movies and from now on this movies won't be interesting as used to be. What future projects or alterations can change our minds?",1

"The studio gets 50  of domestic gross, 40  of overseas (minus China) gross, and 25  of China gross. And on the top of that, they have to pay taxes. A billion dollar movie won't make you much in the box office if your overall budget is something like 400M.",0
"The way he phrases that variation on Clarke s Law, it could be read to mean: Our science is like magic to you. or Our magic is like science to us.

They re gods, they re just gods that live in space.",2

I didnt get the impression that he killed them - beat them up and presumably horribly maimed a couple but I dont think they were killed? Then again it wasnt a particularly memorable movie so I might be wrong.,1
"That's not at all what I was trying to imply. What I was trying to say is that they'll be able to reference almost nothing from Peter's movies, since both of those, and his character development as a whole, revolve heavily around a Marvel Studios property (Tony). Of course you can write Spiderman movies without Iron Man, but the current Spiderman we have revolves around him, and you'd have to drop most of Spidey's character to go without mentioning anything to do with Stark.",1
Agreed. This was truly the start of the MCU and they showed how awesome bringing those movie stars all together on one screen can be.,1

"I'm also annoyed by online personalities who always say  we're all tired of comicbook movies  like, what the fuck are you talking about? They are only getting more and more popular if anything!

I think they showed just the right amount I agree. But its the way the trailer was cut together that didnt do it for me. It felt more like a teaser than an official trailer.,1

If people are so against Marvel's decision maybe they could've petitioned and whined to MCU about it. Instead they gave it a massive opening in cinemas, double Wonder Woman's. Boycott it if it bothers you enough, and that would show them. But instead it's a commercial and PR success.",1
Damn gg my boy,1
Also needs to be pointed out that the deal as is is overwhelmingly in Sony's favour. And that the time and energy Disney puts into a Spider-Man movie could be spent on a similarly successful movie they see a benefit from.  The deal as it stands is basically charity.,0

Maybe. But everyone will know who you are and that you lied. I'd say the hate from that alone wouldn't be worth an early screening. I can imagine people even getting violent if they found out you lied about a serious condition and wasted a bunch of people's time. Definitely not worth it once it gets too big. Plus.

Quit creating fake drama he was never following them in the first place. He doesn t follow Disney either,3
"I absolutely agree with you. It's quite fun to watch but comparing to other movies, well, everyone knows that he's worse than most MCU movies.  But most important is that it's different from what we usually get. As you said, it's wild. And we need some wildness.",1

">Aaaaaand the Disney+ dream is finally facing reality. Not really. The whole point of MCU TV shows is to let the less famous characters have their time in the sun. The big wig actors who are more likely to say no, are also those you want to offer proper movies with anyway. Disney can't really release more than 4 MCU films a year, and the TV shows compensate for the restrictions.",1
I mean those ships in Captain Marvel were shown earlier doing all kinds of crazy dogfighting and they didn t do that when Carol took em out. ,1

"I keep seeing this argument, but it was also 50/50 on production costs too. So it's not quite that simple, right?  If a blockbuster Spider-Man movie costs  150M to  200M, then I suppose your 700M number is the break even point. Considering the first one made  880M or so, then I think they are playing with fire since the backlash / fan boycott will definitely hit it. They only got 1B because it immediately followed the biggest movie of all time. I think they'll be lucky to get  700 with the MCU.",1
Was it weird hearing his accent as being from the UK. Threw me off first time I heard it. He plays a kid from Brooklyn quite well.,1

"Is this where I mention the Asgardian brick maker on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.? The episode was during the crappy first party of Season 1, but if I remember correctly, the character was just an average Asgardian, but that still meant he was immortal and pretty tough.",2

"As a cosplayer, I have to know, what is your favourite costume that you have seen in the MCU? Please do be specific :). My favourites are the Iron Spider, Black Panther (from solo movie+Infinity War+Endgame) and the Iron Man Mark 3. All of which I intend to cosplay. :)",1
"It was cool, but not MCU cool.",2
damn nice,2
"In MCU? I don't believe there's any real definition to what her powers would be classified as. It's just energy and matter manipulation with some telepathy. In the comics? Well, as with anything comics related, especially Marvel, there's not just one answer. But in the larger picture, yes, she controls chaos magic. So in the absence of a more practical explanation from the MCU writers, I'm going to say that yes, MCU Wanda also has the ability to wield chaos magic.",1
My daughter,1
"It s in the agents of shield tv show. Season 3 or 4 I think. Good show, if a bit silly at times l. Would definitely recommend watching",2
Yes it is. Thor was on Thanos' farm.,0

Yeah but this isn't Whedon man. Even with CW only Spidey and Ant-Man were comic relief. Everyone else (especially the villian) were pretty serious,2

Ultimately though, it was for selfish reasons...I just want a 3rd remix tape from a James Gunn GoG.  I freaking love the first two but mainly because I love the movies associated with it.",1
 I hope they'll remember you  referring to the half of humanity that he will spare. Chilling,1
What was the point you realized the MCU was becoming the biggest film franchise of our time?,1
You deserve a Bloody Mary.,1
"Hi Mr. Feige, I just wanted to say that thank you for all the hard work you put into the MCU and for inspiring millions of people. Did you originally plan that the kid in Iron-Man 2 was going to be Peter Parker or did you come up with this idea after Spider-Man joined the MCU. Thank you.",1

"Amazing work! If I had seen this in the wild, I would have assumed it to be official!  I'm curious: how do you organise the catalog of source footage? Or do you just watch everything a lot of times? Like, do you have a folder of kick clips, punch clips, falling clips? Good luck going forward! You have the skills to go far, I think ( ).",1

I am so glad Marvel knows how to make trailers that don't spoil the whole movie.,3
It would be great if Hammer wasn t snapped and has finished his prison sentence,3
That's correct. Cap didn't have much of a role in IW.  Another guess why It's gonna be Cap's movie is because the Russos started with Cap : Winter Soldier in the first place!!,2

Helps her stand out from the crowd. But man oh man was her short hair a mess in the comics and a real hit and miss. Imo it s like this hit: 2016 CM run issues 126 to 128, and guardians of the galaxy 2016 plus a few issues in civil war 2, total miss aka horrendous: spider woman 2016 and end of civil war 2 when she confronts the bad guy,",1
I dont think Vision dies. It's too soon and they havent even come close to fleshing out the character.  I dont think the soul stone is in Wakanda either. I think that in Avengers 4 it appears and this is how they defeat Thanos. Maybe Captain Marvel's movie is where it appears and she brings it from deep space.  ,1
"True. And since it all happened at the same time, odds are the humans that survived and were enslaved by the kree would have no idea what happened.  With that tho. The earth was blown up af.

"SPOILERS FOR AVENGERS 4. My guess is that Vision is killed at the end of the film and Wanda has a breakdown. that clip of them both where he is human looking is her in a coma / catatonic state of denial, where she has created a reality she wants. She may do this with the help of the reality stone.  That sets up Avengers 4 where everyone appears to be back in time (Tony in S.H.I.E.L.D uniform etc.)",1

Lifespans are longer now but that meant that people were dying off around 60 instead of 80 today. Healthy people weren t commonly dropping at 40 yrs old. The average life expectancy was so low because infant mortality rates were so much higher.  ,1

Ooh wonder if this angle could replace the death worship. Thanos has gone mad because due to the prejudice of the eternals he never got respect despite excelling in every feild he applied in.

Because like thanos said it s completely random that s why it wasn t just the bad half,2
"And just like the iPhone, you aren t forced to buy it. ",2
Can someone please make a meme of Thanos lying on a floating door and Leo trying to stay afloat and saying to Thanos  Any room for me?  And Thanos just smiles and says  no ,1
Upvoted and commented for activity. Hope you get to see it bro. Best wishes for a peaceful and painless ending. ,1
"ya if this needed to parallel frankenstein, i do think more setup would be needed.  i wonder if part of the rush is they felt they needed to START approaching the idea of thanos, so they had to get some plot goals in. i didnt realize whedon did avengers 2 also because avengers 1 felt so much more coherent compared to 2.  but i guess that's writing and not directing.",1
"I made my neighbor watch Infinity War after *only* having seen the first Iron Man and the first Guardians movie to see what he d think. He said that it was obviously hard to follow sometimes, but for the most part he thought they did a good job of juggling so many  main  characters in one movie and he really enjoyed it. If I had a friend who hadn t seen any of the MCU movies at all I would ve shown them the movie too, but those people are hard to come by these days, lol. ",1
"This is the greatest superhero battle in film history, period. Nothing comes close",1
How do you guys decide which comics to look at for storylines?,1
They keep telling everyone to move on. Some do. But not us.,3
"Warner says they are in no rush since they had some script problems. They say they only want Taika to direct and no one else, so they will wait for him to first do Thor 4 and then return to the project. Looks like they are really confident in him and his vision for Akira",3
okie,1
"A Blue Marvel movie would work really well imo. You could get the campy feel that comics had during the 1960s (with an actual cloth costume to help provide that feel) , and have it juxtaposed with his storyline during that time period.",1
lol I really like this!,1
Thank you very much for replying!,1
*screenshot of portals scene*,1
He could have been dressed as Gamora.,1
Do I need any context other than watching Infinity War before watching this movie?,1
Or play mk11,1
"But in a leaked clip, the Guardians are sneaking up on Thanos presumably in the Collectors museum as he s bullying the Collector into giving him the reality stone. I m thinking that s what makes the Guardians go to Earth. Reality is either 1, 2 , or 3 on this list",1
I hate that movie,1
ronin one shot.,1
That's the Joss Whedon version of the script.,2
Because people will pay it because it has the smell of exclusivity,1
Damn apparently we like despicable movies. O well.,1
"I'm aware, I never implied he created it.",1
"But all that backstory and stuff is one thing (though the screenwriters should have significant leeway in changing all of that to fit the movies as well), but we are talking about aesthetic stuff, like if they should cast a wee lad to play Wolverine just for the sake of being  comic accurate.  I say nay. Being *that* tied down to the comics is a mistake. The comics should be a spring board, not a ball-and-chain.",0
"The crops Thanos is walking through, is that the same fruit from GotG 2?",1
"That's so easy to shoop, especially for somebody who's hacking her account in the first place to post it.",2
"Right. I think I do this when I try to sing too much into my mask. Do we agree that it is clear here that he is obviously a capable singer, and what s going on in the video is totally fixable with some work with a voice coach?",2

"More like 'Guardians of the delicate moral fabric of our society', am I right? ",1
"Hey Kevin, is there any chance of getting more character origin stories light on the  origin  part, similar to Spiderman: Homecoming in phase 4 and beyond? Will it focus more on team origins like the X-Men and Fantastic 4 or something entirely different? Personally I'd love to see a MoonKnight on the big screen someday, curious about what the future holds.",2

"This made my day. They said it would never happen, but this franchise is back on track. Many of the jokes didn't work in the second movie, but the emotional moments are some of the best in the mcu, and the third one will probably be even better.",2
Anyone else not into cgi? That is about 99.9  of mcu so meh I'll pass.,1

this is why I can t wait to see more of Scott   Hope. Im so sure they re gonna makeup for it in the next Ant man movie. They are marvels most iconic couple afterall.,1
Have you not played the games or do you just not understand what the word potential means?,1

Absolutely nothing.,1

"Here's the thing about Wanda: If she looks like she's going to say  no more mutants , shut her up.",1
This is one of the few things I can see 'both sides' of and I don't have a firm opinion. Which is rare for me generally. ,2
Chances are that it will have something to do with the consequences of Endgame and/or Ragnar k. Within those guidelines anything can be done.,1
What was the rat's name?,1
Me three,1
"See below for Ned, Happy, May, MJ, and Bailey As for Flash, hes supposed to be Agent Venom, so he to goes to Sony Basically, all of those characters except Happy goes to Sony",1
I thought this too but I like the build up. It's more satisfying - like how Cap had peeks of scale armour in Infinity War then full blown in Endgame,2
The part that makes it even worse than the ones is Infinity War is that they all knew that would happen if Thanos wins and so they saw it coming. Hawkeye didn't. Just imagine a loved one dying in front of you without any warning. This movie is gonna rip me apart,1
Ladies and gentlemen We got him. I'm so happy for him.,1

"Hey Kevin!! Congratulations on Endgame!  Since Disney got Fox, will we see a new Fantastic Four movie soon or will it take some time? And will they join the Avengers family or will they do their separate adventures? Also, thank you for the best Cinematic Universe ever created! Kudos to everyone!",1
"Idk, considering the size of the MCU you would expect something more memorable. It's pretty good, but I wouldn't recall it if asked to name great movie scores.",2
Don't say something you won't be able to take back,1
Holy Hell.... ,1
"I noticed the disney+ version has much quieter dialogue, I had to crank my TV volume just to hear the talking. Anyone else notice that?",1
Can't wait to watch the movie and have the suit be CGIed all over like black panther did.,1
I think it would be genius on their part to introduce Miles and have him be Peter's sidekick at some point in the future after he graduates high school. They already hinted at Miles in Homecoming when Peter was interrogating the Prowler. Peter doesn't have to die in order for Miles to exist...,1
"I missed it the first time because her hair was pulled back, usually she has it loose.",1
From civil war to infinity wars? I feel like they could have represented that better ,2
"The jack in america living his life scenes are amazing. I didnt love the 55  of the show that was from the terrorists families point of view.  It just got old.  They would've been good as their own show, I would like to watch a show just about them, but for the show  jack ryan , I wanted to see more of jack ryan being badass.",1
You saw it on his face in the last moments of IW.  There's this tiny snap of realisation that for everyone to live - some people including Tony will have to die.,1

Hmmm.. The one with all the dirt I'm assuming you on about. Then someone comes up behind and he turns... We need to delve DEEPER,1
I've never heard it called that before now. I've only seen people say that it has elements of a political thriller.,1
"It was because it was a 3-d film. Why do people seem to not mention this? The CGI and story were okay, but the entire huge selling point was the first major release of a 3-d film done well.",2
I did that fist pump when I saw spiderman won best animated award ,1
"Man, he would of been a superstar superhero. Didnt even think of that.",3
That last scene is freaking golden.  Like Mantis standing there... hai!  Excellent trailer... Living up to the hype! Edi: Groot's a teenager :D:D ,2
Yep! I'm looking forward to it.,1
I just came to say thank you,1
Tony jizzed some nanites on it.,1

Can you do a 2 minute long video?,3
The Brazilian title translates to Ultimatum instead of Endgame. Hmmmmm.,1
Or stress greyed him. Tony had worst week after Thor and Banner.,1
.... Isn't Brie Larson supposed to be a professional actor? What the fuck was the line delivery in this? She conveyed 0 emotion in the entire trailer. She seems like a very bad actor and I am significantly less excited for this movie.,3
That s not how it works. In Iger s book he explains how they just give money and then distribute. They don t get hands on with the making of the films. Because Marvel and Lucasfilm are their own branches with their own staff. Disney is just a distributed when it comes to their subsidiaries. All they do is make money. Marvel and Lucasfilm are the ones making the choices.,2
This is top tier man lmao,2
That is sick!,1
"This is why TDW ranks so low on many  best mcu film  lists.  You cannot play the ever-escalating-threat game, and have world ending stakes in solo films when you know there are several more movies coming.  There are no real threats.",3

"While I sincerely appreciate him sticking with Gunn, my question is a what if. What if James Gunn was not allowed back at all, would it have been right for him to not come back as Drax?

wasn't Hawkeye retired in civil war 2? He came back to you know.. kill hulk,2
mmmm keep going,3
Well even then Disney should've just tried to get 20  of the movie revenue and slowly convinced Sony to completely sell if that's what they want,1

"It's left open ended. In Infinity War, he says nobody else can wield it because their minds would crumble into madness. But it could've been bluster and bravado on Thor's part. Though he certainly has the ability to summon Stormbreaker to him like he did with Mjolnir. ",1
"Good Job OP,It's amazing! :D",1
Who's the woman in the top right?,1
Holy. Fuck.,1
Was Tobey Maguire s Spider-Man ever considered being part of the MCU? I remember reading rumors about it on forums back about ten or so years ago that he was.,1
"But that's the character not Brie Larson, you know... Apart from that, she was hit by a Fucking monster battery and therefore instant strong  ",2
Kinda surprised Hulk is staying in the back. He could just jump into the middle of the enemy horde from like a mile away. He'd take out many of them too with the force of the impact. ,2

"You re not wrong, but there is a grey area, and I m not claiming to know where that begins and ends, but for anyone with an opinion on this situation, I d be curious how often you react this same way to others, whether it be unfriending them because of something they ve said ages ago, or where you ve defended them against it after they ve likely changed since. Just interesting where people make up their line to not cross and how it s entirely based on that individual over another.",1
"Disney is trying to grow so fast because they are scared of the likes of comcast, who could shut them out of tv media wholesale",1
> He made marvel      What are YOU doing on this subreddit?,3
Did you work closely with Stan Lee or Jack Kirby on early development of the MCU? Or did you adapt existing stories and characters with frequent consultation with other Marvel comic story tellers or artists? Or did you take most of the influence straight from the source documents itself and consult with the authors and artists minimally in order to keep stories more original?,1
> who owns the film rights to Deadpool? Um... Disney? Where you been the past 10 months lol,1

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE GROOOUUUND!!!,2
"In her defense, she just witnessed all the people that she know get dusted. When the adrenaline die down and she got time to think about it, I think she feel confused. And for all the abuse she went through under Thanos, in the end he is still her father. Her version in IW broke down when she thought she killed him. So in this scene I think it is pretty understandable.",1
That s how I feel about the new Star Wars too. Same shit over and over.,2
I booked too late. I wanted my first watch in imax 3D and the earliest showtime I can make it had no good seats left. Had to start at 10:30 pm imax 3D after I checked the night before release someone cancelled their seat and then 2:00 AM for Dolby that same night. Seen it 4x since then. Titanic is still my  1 Favourite film though so bit sad it got beat. But Endgame is worthy of beating it.,1

Got it from a friend who had taken doses off of the same pad before, so I knew it wasn't TOO bad at the very least. Was my first time taking any. Definitely interested in doing it again. Was an interesting experience, to be sure. Visuals in the movie were crazy, wish I had a surround sound system though, that would have made it next level. Was watching on a shitty site with my headphones, so not ideal.",1

I honestly don t know why they didn t just name these two films after the comic books. If A3 was called Infinity Gauntlet and A4 was called Infinity War that would have been so cool.,3

"That's literally what happened with Blade Runner. Harrison Ford hated the idea of the voiceover narration the original release had, but he was contractually obligated to do it. So he purposely phoned it in as much as he could. Problem was though, he was narrating a  world weary noir detective  archetype, so it kind of ended up matching the tone of character regardless. ",2

"I agree with that. I will give it a chance, but I have to admit it won't be easy because she looks like someone that would be on CW to me and it will really hard to break my hatred for the childish writing on those shows. The people who are reacting about empowerment aren't doing so for no reason though with the way that Disney has let SW progress and with the magazine cover and article. Any slight hint that politics will be pushed in it will make them feel as if Marvel may be doing the same.",0

The only problem with this is that it s too good. I need a kinda shitty 1965 version of this?,1
Well ... no. They are full of heart and soul. The creators are every bit as sincere as Coppola and Scorsese have been with their work.

"This sub is embarrasingly out of touch when it comes to the X-Men in general. Like, 9 out of 10 X-Men posts are about people saying that the line-up for the first movie should be the Original Five, and it makes me want to scream into the void. Just...why on earth would you choose to adapt the objectively worst and weakest era of the X-Men as their stellar MCU debut?",0
"Hi Kevin! In your opinion what character from the comics was the hardest to adapt to the big screen, whether it be because they were so powerful it was hard to ground them or you just didn t think it would translate to the big screen well.",1
"You're right. It's complete BS. Endgame never got a formal rerelease in the US. It never left theaters here. They did a minor expansion the week before FFH with some more domestic screens and a second run in a few foreign nations where it had left, but it wasn't an actual rerelease. Of the two, *only* Avatar left theaters and returned to make more money.",1
Even Matt Murdoch saw this was a losing case.,1

They didn't say she wasn't either as far as I remember so they still could play that card. I listed her as an Avenger just because she is one rather than X-Men currently.,1
"Um, what are you talking about?  It's been done exactly three times - BvS, Justice League and this film.  It's not quite to the  getting a bit old  stage yet...especially when we already know Marvel won't blunder their way through it like DC did.",1

*Stuffs cash into stranger's wallet* whatever it takes!!,2
But the X-Men comics were the first to have one person throw someone at an enemy as an attack and call it  the fastball special . I'm not saying the others  stole  the move or that it's anything malicious--they're probably homages as fans. But the move literally started from the X-Men in the 1970s and not a video game that came out 40 years later.,1

Lemme just grab my time stone real quick,1
"Well ok, but you can't be really selective with criticism, mainly because it is offered by others. Truth is not everyone will find your creative work to be artful enough, or good, or even creative at all. Criticism from industry giants like Coppola and Scorcese is painful, these guy's opinion have weight, they are proven legends. Sure, it sucks fo get flak from them, but maybe try to  see  how they are correct in their perspective? At best this is a humbling experience for any type of creator.",1

"I gotta agree to an extent. I'm not one of the people who minds jokes, but Hulk really got short changed in Endgame.",3
"They could have, but didn't. Probably to avoid creating a new timeline where Black Widow doesn't exist (like how there's an alternate universe where Gamora, Nebula, Thanos and his entire army suddenly disappeared). Of course, you could then ask why Cap didn't seem to have any issue creating a whole new timeline to be with Peggy.",3

And on top of that, that blue shit is coasting along the streets in Missouri and SHIELD nor the Avengers are at all concerned? Hard to believe.",1

I'm really excited but the IMO the title is boring and safe. Releasing the title this late and letting us hype for so long was dumb. Didn't Russos say in an interview that the title was shocking and give everyone lots of emotions? Or that it was a spoiler? I dunno. We knew it was the Endgame! ,1
Turns out both studios could set aside their differences and realize they both love money.,3
Why do I feel like Ryan Reynolds would be the biggest leak risk in Marvel history?,2

I can't imagine the collective nerdgasm that would explode from the creation of a Deadpool/Holland Spidey film.,3

Nice to see hope in some promotional material. ,1

My guess is he will appear in the multiverse of madness. Switch universes and all that.,1
"Yes, the final reveal of the full scene makes it worth it. ",2
I totally thought we were going to see some fake Spidey/chameleon stuff in FFH. And still could as a fallout of Mysterio holo tech i suppose. Which could play into Peter getting the new symbiote suit okay,1

Since Mark Ruffalo Bruce Banner hasn t gotten a solo film yet, do you have any plans to introduce RJ into the MCU?

....yes an actor is an artist. A violinist playing a Beethoven piece is still an artist.,1
"The Loki character is the only decent thing about those movies, Thor post ragnarok was waaaay more likeable. It went from my least favourite to my favourite avenger!",2
Remember the scene from the Infinity Wars trailer when all the avengers were running together and that was never in the movie? Same might happen to Tony being on Earth with everyone else in the new suit.,1
Hi Kevin! At what point did you realise that the MCU was really coming together and it was all working and you could fully commit to the Infinity Saga?,2

Fucking amazing,1

Greatest post credit scene IMO,1

"True, but that's not how it works according to the fictional writer of this movie",1
No no... That's not the same.  Roman Polanski is a rapist. And a child abuser. That's a fact.  James Gunn has broken no laws. He made some bad jokes ten years ago. I think the liberal thing to do here is to recognise when someone's moved past that. ,0

There would've been no  political fallout.   The whole absurd mess started with alt-righters trolling the web for payback for Roseanne getting fired.  Actual rape apologists and wifebeaters took years-old twitter jokes out of context and made a big stink and Disney fell for it. These MAGA trolls aren't going to have one iota of impact on the MCU's success or Disney's bottom line.  They've tried boycotts several times and they've all failed spectacularly.,2

Hank had tried so hard to bring Hope's mother back to reconcile the problem, that he ruined their relationship. He tells Scott this is a chance to save his relationship with his own daughter. Rather than trying to fix the mistakes he's committed, he's more committed to making sure Scott doesn't make the same mistakes",1

"When adapting the comics into film many aspects of the lore have been altered, I understand this and most of the changes I think were excellent decisions, however there is one tiny trivial change that I've been wondering about for years. x200B Is there a reason you called them Infinity Stones in the MCU rather than Infinity Gems?",1
Love that! Wasn t expecting it. ,1
They ve started shooting already? nice,0
Just like Bro Thor,2
But then why would Rocket not be looking for that distress call. This is the thing I'm hating seeing on this sub. Everyone wants Captain Mavel as the focus of End Game but it would be a total disservice to the old characters to do so. It makes the most sense for Rocket to be looking for his ship and Thor to help him find it with his Bifrost ability. ,1
Not a question really but tell him to do xmen in the 90s animated version,1
Asking the real questions here.,2
Thanos is definitely not throwing a punch at Steve here. Looks like he is reaching out for something and Cap is trying to hold him back. Thanos looks more confused then fearful.,2
This could also be applied to Dragon Ball word for word. Goku started out struggling to lift a car. Now Super Saiyan God Goku can destroy the entire galaxy if he wanted to.,1

End of watch (the cop movie with Luis from Ant-Man) is insane too! I highly recommend it,1
That ending tho,1
Hulk was in the Infinity War trailer.,1
He also wasn t utterly wasted.  Drax has done absolutely nothing since he fought 3 guards in the prison break of GotG1.  You could remove him entirely and all you d miss is a couple one liners and some humorously strange interactions.,3
Isn t that like the appeal of Spider-Man in general?,3

"Except Endgame never went off the circuit and the rerelease content was after the credits meaning nothing had really changed , it's still the same movie released back in April. If they want to do an extended cut then they probably will later in the year or early next year depending on how Avatar rererelease goes. Why did Avatar need a rerelease ? it was an average movie in the first place , just technically brilliant for the time but dated now compared with most of the marvel films.",1

However, there are episodes in there that are very important character developing moments that the writers do not forget about. By episode 10-11, it picks up and once you hit episode 17, it's non stop awesomeness. Helps if you binge it like I did. Honestly the first part isn't as bad as people say. ",1

Can we talk about how good Spectacular Spiderman was? Though I think the recent Disney show was better.,1

Because it acknowledges Tibetan as an ethnicity seperate from Chinese. China only accepts something like 30 foreign films a year and it's hard to make the cut.

"And James has more than accepted being fired from Disney for his actions.  It s not like he s begging for his job back.  But you need to keep in mind, these jokes were 10 years ago. Rosanne made racist comments recently.  There s a huge difference. Disney had a right to fire both, but to say James is a hypocrite is misinformed.

"I find it interesting that Fury is so much more prominent in the film than I thought he would be.  It looks like in the  present day  (for the film at least, the 90s for us) she's spending most of her time with Fury.  That means that Marvel is so confident with their de-aging tech that they're using it for the bulk of a whole movie now.  And I will say, it looks great.

"I d say it used to be the most underrated part of the MCU but the last 3 seasons have brought the show back to an sometimes outstanding/mostly solid level of quality which has then resulted in loads of fans saying it s the best MCU show etc. Most underrated for me would be Luke Cage, which is typically maligned by everyone due to the lacklustre first season, however i d say the second season is really the best of the Netflix MCU.",3

"Gah, I remember every issue of Wizard Magazine had fan casting for comic book movies, and it was always big stars, like Patrick Stewart for Professor X.

"It's not exactly an unfair deal to want 50/50 profits when you're the one paying for half the movie and doing 100  of the work to make it.

Disney can let Sony move on while the character is basically frozen in the MCU. And if Sony falls flat on their face and comes back to Disney they can just start up where they left off. In the meantime the MCU has plenty of other stories to keep them occupied and none of them affect or are affected by Spider Man not being around.",2

It wasn t attached to their product until they made a big deal about it.  Nobody cared about this until Disney fired the guy. How many people do you know who watches marvel movies?

I really wish they didn't show the Hulk or banner in trailers. That would have been amazing to be surprised by that. I mean its an MCU movie. Anyone that would go to see it for the Planet Hulk aspect was going to see it anyways.,2

Disney has to buy Spider-Man from Sony Pictures but people love Spidey no matter where it is. (This sub is simply a tiny part of it.) I think Sony understands that.,3
"Yes, because he's a gentleman.",1
"That moment when Thor says,  do not say that name  and clutches at Hulk's shirt.... I just wish Hulk hadn't said,  take your hands off me . It just seemed so uncalled for.  Or when he wants to wear the gauntlet, to do the snap but Tony says no, because of Thor's condition. Thor says,  do you know what courses through these veins?  and Rhodey says,  Cheese whiz?   Again, totally uncalled for  but the Russos were going for an easy laugh, so what should I have expected?",1

Hi Kevin.  Congrats on your achievement with Endgame.  My question is that is there a possible mini series in the works about Captain America and his trip back to return the stones?   Would love to see another interaction between him and Red Skull.,1

What s your favourite MCU movie and favourite movie in general?,1
"Considering it was spliced next to other Skrull scenes, absolutely. ",1
"I feel kind of the same way. After Endgame, I'm probably not going to be excited as I was before it was released. The only MCU related things I'm excited about are the Doctor Strange sequel   the shows for Falcon   Winter Soldier, Loki, and Hawkeye.",1
"As is normal. You telling me that if you go on a first date, ask them what their favourite show is, you aren t going to think of them differently if they say  keeping up with the kardashians  vs  the wire ?",3
"The man has shown nothing but focus in his appearances.  He is on the threshold of finishing his great mission.  His expression is plainly surprise and disbelief.  He is a mad god, a god does not toy with bacteria when true godhood is within reach.  Thats the expression of a God who has steamrolled Worlds being resisted by a cockroach.  And not being sure how thats possible.",2

Breathtaking.,1

"Really interesting little thought experiment. I think they'd die out quickly because organisms that size are made to be stronger for their size, or at least very fast.

"Yep, it usually comes from the left. But that doesn't change the fact that this is a right-wing political hit job. There's also no hypocrisy, the left honestly believes in social justice values in good faith, the right does not, but it weaponizes it in bad faith. Thus, the hypocrisy is entirely from the right. Also, on the merits of the specific cases, the Gunn case is objectively less bad than those fired due to left-wing outrage.",0

Well said my friend - this sums up my feelings on this exactly.,1
**EXCELSIOR**,1
"He didn t get Perlmutter fired. What Feige did was convince Iger to make Marvel Studios completely separate subsidiary from Marvel Entertainment and by doing so Feige only has to report to Iger directly and Perlmutter has zero influence on the movies, but he s still in charge of the comics, TV shows and everything else that isn t movies. ",2
"Well, we'll see who is right then, won't we (won't be you). I mean, the Disney+ streaming show is called the Winter Soldier and the Falcon, so you've pretty much already lost this one. It's not called Captain America 2.0, there is no Captain America in the title. BTW Statistics mean everything, it's how Hollywood is run. In fact, I'm willing to bet Disney paid for that survey.  Also, I'm going to remind you of this conversation come April 26th.  RemindMe! 80 Days  Was Bucky made Cap ",1

Bring them into the current MCU or keep them separate universes? Do a format similar to MCU with individual character movies and team movies ramping up to an epic fight for the universe?",1
"Maybe. It seems like it was just her normal hair but since the helmet had this weird break in the middle of her head, it was poking out. That's what it seemed like to me. I am hoping she has a mohawk though. Be so bad-ass.",1
"Hello Mr. Feige, big fan of your work! Does hulk still have the potential to contribute to the future of the MCU? Considering his arm was incredibly shriveled up, it s safe to say he needs time to heal, but do you see him coming back at some point and play a significant role down the line?",1

"Don't forget Bruce Banner though! I don't know how but it seems that Hulk will come out, probably a 2v1 between Thor, Hulk and Thanos. That would set the premise of just how disgustingly Powerful Thanos is at the start of the movie. Looks like Banner is taking the role of Silver Surfer in the comics and is the one who will warn Strange and Wong.",3

so....do they have the costumes at home? are these costumes property of marvel? are they being paid to be here? so many questions,1
"Hey Kevin! Thank you so much for this amazing cinematic universe you have crafted. I was wondering, what are your thoughts on the show Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D? Would you like it to interact with the movies more closely?",1
Any way you could get the Russo brothers to direct a new fantastic four with doctor doom?,1
"Depends on what you mean on important. Overall plot-wise? Not really. Lot's of assumptions can be made from the new snippets they've shown, but it'd still just be guessing.",2
"On the other hand, they left the girl power scene in. Edit: oh wow, so many downvotes? Look, I'm just saying the scene with the  she's got help  with a bunch of characters who barely know each other all gathering is incredibly contrived. I have nothing against female heroes.",0

"Hi Kevin, thanks for doing this. I was wondering, were there any movies or characters that were planned or you wanted to introduce earlier, or was the order of the MCU always pretty set in the order it ended up releasing in? Were there characters you wanted to introduce in another characters movie that maybe didn t work out, whether they were introduced later or not? Also, I know you might not be able to say, but are we ever going to see The Leader again?",1
Any chance we ll get to see Thor go to Ralphs?,1
"I think this one is good if you had to choose. Maybe convince your roommate to add in Fantastic Beasts so you get 2 more? I would add in Doctor Strange and Ragnarok. Though for sure, this is super unsatisfying. What if you just watched the first 8 and then they'd be hooked and willing to watch the rest regardless?",1
Pretty damn amazing!,1
Chris Evans said that he cried while watching the first hour of the movie and the movie is allegedly 3 hours long.I wonder who dies in the first act of the movie,1
"Wait, really? For someone who subscribed to this sub, that seems surprising. Maybe try watching one a week if you have a busy schedule? You can look up the order of release online, or at least watch civil war and the Avengers movies in order",1

"Totally agreed. And if anything, they'll be able to give him some kind of emotional send-off that'll leave people crying. People will remember it as one of Spidey's greatest moments, and regardless of what Sony does afterwards, it'll immortalize the MCU Spidey and his place in fans' hearts.",3
"YES Endgame was always the best fan name, that s what I m most hyped about",1
Disney now owns Marvel and is launching a competing streaming service.  Either Disney is ratcheting up the price to license the characters  or Netflix simply doesn't want to make a show that they have to pay a competitor for.,1

"OP s point still kind of stands, maybe instead of a tech upgrade it was just a tactical one: make sure the Chitari mothership is nowhere near the fucking battlefield, in fact, let s just leave it back in time (this is actually more of an issue, how were the chitari still connected to the hive mind or whatever when they aren t even in the same timeline anymore?)",3
"Did they give you a number to call if you got lost? I think you re in the wrong place, little guy.",1

"Hey, I need some feedback on something I noticed in the trailer. When Thor is raising his hand and triggers the lightning, his hand position is absolutely not natural for someone NOT holding something, his wrist is slightly bent, look : https://imgur.com/a/Y2Jd2 Could they have edited out his future weapon not to spoil it ? A bit like how they showed him with both his eyes in the comic-con trailer and later CGI'd his eyepatch for the official trailers ?",1

Your saying the MCU ISN'T part of the reason why FFH grossed as much as it did?  That's absolutely incorrect.  A significant part of the marketing leveraged that it was post-Endgame and the official end to Phase 3.  Not to mention the trailer featured Fury very prominently.,1

"I mean, you can file a lot under that. Most people, even Marvel fans, didn't think they were going to gain any traction. Marvel's movie record was less than stellar and the characters involved in the MCU initially had been mismanaged for years  Thor had been actually cancelled a few years prior to his movie and didn't have an ongoing.",1
I guess deep down he was the most useful avenger,1
"It's a source pointing to the AMA where he avoided the AoS continuity questions.

"What's your opinion on your Competitors DC/WB and their current state? Also thank you for the time and effort you've invested into your projects, it's amazing to continually see movies that tick off fans wishlists, while still being movies the general public can enjoy.",1

Eh there s that one part we can all hum along to.  That s it. Star Wars had multiple themes you could hum along to from memory.  Silvestri is great but Williams is Goat  it s no shame to take an L to him.  Even Zimmer has to kneel and suck it.,1

"To be fair to Disney, if a director I employed was found to have tweeted literally dozens of Pedo jokes, I would remove him from my franchise too. They are risking their image of a family and kid friendly company by pushing this under the carpet.  I'm not insinuating that he is a Pedo or anything, but jokes like that aren't well received by the general public, worse even with parents.",0
Loki also ties into Dr Strange apparently,3

I think it's pretty funny how she's got nothing better to do than to go watch her own movie.  ,1
"What about Korg, Meik, Heimdall, Janet and Hank",1
"Huh, I was under the impression that studios got closer to 75  domestic and 50  internationally. That makes Disney's offer with the 50  financing split seem less outrageous for sure.",1
Help this guy out someone!,3
What you guys want is someone with the same functionality as Dr Doom.,1
Yasssss!!!! SpikeyTortoise did a new one!!!!,1
What is your most memorable moment as a part of the MCU?,1
Depends if they have enough money though...then they move to passion projects. I recall DiCaprio took pay cuts to work with Tarantino because the former respects the latter.,1
Hands down best movie of the year.,1
"I'm very conservative leaning, and most everyone I talked with was annoyed with him being fired. I don't see how you can attribute the actions of an individual to an entire group, and it or it was the SJW left who reacted and called for him to be fired.  ",0
That s who I was thinking of! I couldn t figure it out until I read that. ,2
"Now that we have alt timelines and universes, every show can be MCU, just another timeline.",1
Can I be your assistant?,1
Well eyes wide shut supposedly got re-edited after kubricks death and dare I say Barry lyndon is the most boring movie I've ever seen,2
"Hey Kevin! Thanks for doing this! My question is: When can we expect to here what the line up for future films (more specifically Phase 4)?  We know about GotG3, Black Widow, and Dr. Strange 2, but when will they be and when will we hear about the others?",1
Holy... so I just realized that the Avengers have now come full circle. It all began with the original members and all 6 survived the decimation to reach the endgame. Goosebumps.,1
Sounds like a campy 80s dnd module,1
"Nope, no Democrats defending pedophiles here by completely ducking the question. Still waiting for you to show me even one joke out of literally hundreds that actually constitutes humor. ",1
"My call is that Tony dies adrift in space, but they bring him back via time travel / quantum realm.  ",1
Wish we saw that bottom frame of giant man and wasp!,1
 Thanos is canceled ,1
"Oh man, this shit makes me happy.",1
Simultaneously harsh and true.,2
"judelaw aint here for no reason, yall",1
Anyone else get chills from that score? ,1
I wonder how he would react seeing all these nice comments ?,1
Trailer feels *exactly* how I would want a Green Lantern movie done. ,1
I like how they opened with an ass shot to show they fixed it. lol ,1
Pickle Rick: green She-Hulk: green Coincidence: I think not,1
Ten years of leading to this crossroad and you bitch about it. You can see your way out.,1
I was really hoping for D+ to flop,2
>paging u/anthony-russo and u/Joe-russo x200B ,2
I don't want them anywhere near WB.,1
"He was 30+ years old. He made HUNDREDS of these  jokes  with ZERO context. He then attempted to delete them. He's a comedian and many comedians joke about their subconscious beliefs, struggles and standards. Robin Williams, Louis CK, and many others show this. He associates with convicted child predators. That's not how GbA works.  You are wrong, wrong, and wrong.",1
" Someone already made this, so here you go. (url)",1
Lmao this is too good. Nicely done,1
Dude. You MADE that?? Fucking kickass,1
This trailer was phenomenal!!!!!!!!!. Avengers Infinity War will be magnificent. I can't wait.,1
I literally just got done watching it and you are incorrect. The helmet is off during that fight which is really odd considering Thanos not only elbows Tony in the face but punches him. There was just zero consistency to the movie or Thanos's strength.,0
When did back to school fit into all this...ohh shit it's a Dangerfield timeline....run run run. ,1
"I m a noob and totally can t remember from the films and don t read comics, where are all the infinity stones except the one in Vision?",1
Love this 3000,1
I seem to recall people speculating that some of the events of the film take place up to 5 years later. That said looking at stark it only seems like a few months so that ship must ve been really bare,2
You need a cup,1
"https://youtu.be/QEaBcdIfNMU here's a better link, sorry :)",1
"Yeah I mean it was definitely a reactionary decision based on some outside pressure, but the tweets were definitely in poor taste. Even James admitted that he was doing it at a time when he wanted to get a rise out of people. The way that James took the movie with dignity and didn't shirk it or belittle it at all really was amazing and set a tremendous tone for how these things ought to be handled. I commend him greatly for this and I'm wildly excited to have him back at the helm. ",3
I already got reddit wood.,1
I love you 3000 Howard Potts,2
"Correct, the people you listed are pretty much what Captain America is to us, they are to the average Asgardian. ",3
"ITS ACTUALLY YOU. Firstly, congratulations on creating such an amazing universe. I cannot help but feel happy for you. And thank you, massively, might I add. Secondly, to the questions - 1) What do you think has been the greatest moment in the Infinity Saga?  2) How do you think Endgame has affected the MCU going forward?  and also a colossal thank you to the mods! :)",1
Time to go request Moon Knight seasons 2 to 50,1
"Just about the most perfect teaser/trailer I ve ever seen. That music btw!!! So desolate, despairing and awe-inspiring combined with those raw, still images of the void of outer space. I got Metroid vibes from it all, especially with the shot of the scarecrow and alien crops alongside that music and the space Tony stuff. ",1
Get Henry Cavill to play him to flex on DCEU mothers.,2
Can anyone explain the choice of Happy?,1
You're on. Gold if I'm wrong. ,1
...haven t seen Ragnarok yet huh?,3
Lots of got characters have plot armor too. ,2
"Don t think they ll care tbh. They have bond and Tarantino and fans who (now here s the crazy part) just want a good bit of entertainment and don t really care about the most expensive tv show ever made. Sure, it d be cool for him to come back, but if he doesn t, just move on. And currently, looks like he won t.",0
Because a speech at an award show is like a 25 second  thanks to everyone for...    This was like...I don t know what this was. It was like someone who hasn t been to college just tried to debate you at debate club in college. It was bizarre.   It was also sooooooooooooo divisive and spiteful.  You can feed into it but I don t enjoy it. I m gonna go see Captain Marvel for the 3rd time tomorrow and freaking enjoy it.,1
Idk if this is an unpopular opinion but I m not a fan of mark ruffalo s bruce banner,1
Uh until I see Captain America use his hair to interface with Agent Carter's braid so they can have sex in the world tree I'd hardly call this a well done franchise /s,1
"Brie Larsson meets me, working night shift!",1
Marvel Studios could work with Hulu anytime?,1
Or wakanda ,1
Hey looks like he went with his mom to a museum and this is one of the pictures that she took in front of one of the exhibits.,2
This would have been such a great addition to the final film. Like this scene alone gave me the chills,0
GOOSEBUMPS AND TEARS AT THE SAME TIME. HELP.,1
"Yea. He dropped it like... 7 feet away from Tony, its not like its gone forever lol",3
Ultimate!,3
I m glad this was cut. All I could think of is being at one of my boys youth baseball games and how when one kid gets that wimpy ass injury and starts crying all you hear is  take a knee   shouted all across stupid baseball field. I m jaded though- four boys going through youth sports will do that to you.,1
I can't remember a movie series getting me as hype as this just with a fucking tailer. Literally screamed at the top of my lungs when Hawkeye turned around.,1
"Also, lots of Gambit and Rogue flirting.",1
ANTMAN BESTMAN,1
Thanos  farm is where Thor is,3
 *transforms * *demolishes building * *roars with laughter *,3
So what is in this that actually won't be in the film?,1
I think Kevin Feige said that any footage in the trailers will be from the first 20 minutes of the movie.,2
"Oh just a few people in NYC who have powers called the defenders, maybe Quake, Yoyo, May, Mac, etc.",1
It won't,2
Or in this case with the box only!  ),1
"Spider-Man isn't coming back, it can't be undone. At least that's what Sony had to say. Maybe you ought to talk to them. Go grab your hammer and you fly and talk to them.",0
Squirrel Girl wya,1
In my head I see him totally crushing on her and flirting with her like he did Valkyrie and she s just oblivious the whole time.  * cut to Thor alone*     I don t understand why she doesn t like me. She d probably like me if I still had my hair ,2
Gunn got a taste of what liberals do to conservatives everyday with their outrage mob witch hunts and harassment campaigns,0
What exactly do you have in mind for the MCU in the coming years? Rather than specific films I'm asking about the direction you want to take the MCU as a whole.,1
What comic book event would you have been interested in adapting in the MCU? Which hero/villain did you have the most fun working with and which one of the newly acquired fox characters are you most excited to adapt? Lastly who s your favorite C-list character?,1
"I fucking knew it was end game man, it was just too perfect. Beautiful trailer though.",1
"Thor, Banner, and Hawkeye will still be part of the newer movies/shows tho",1
Sooo Hot!,0
"Pfft, still doesn't beat Flippy Lid  (Original Soundtrack)...",1
"*three little orphans: one, two, three...*",2
 cool    monkaS,1
"I want to say that that specific decision did probably help with X-Men being taken more seriously at that time, but we now live in an MCU world. Bring on the yellow spandex!",2
And snookie. ,1
"Captain Marvel is March, Avengers is late April. But all Spring.",1
Now it's information,1
Jon Bernthal's doodle is awesome.,1
"You never know when something will be the last time. The last time you pick up your kids, the last time you see a loved one, the last time you see Ironman suitup.",1
Bravo   bravo  !!! I was very impressed and I really enjoyed watching this. Good job  ,1
Did the surgery go well? ,1
"My reaction was  Who?  then I googled him, looked through his IMDb page  Oh... The Human Torch? That s... a choice. ",1
"True, or they didn't know...",1
Tony didn't make it to Earth tho. She did ,0
Do we ever see Thanos' shoes? In this pic they're covered by grass I wonder if  they had to constantly make an effort to hide his feet,3
Magic is just magic we don t understand yet.,1
Had to make Thor fat so he couldn't do this in Endgame so that Captain Marvel could do it instead.,1
"If the Kree did experiment on her, Captain Marvel is technically an inhuman yeah?",1
Nicely done and 100  accurate.,1
"That makes sense, yeah.  But Bifrost death would be interesting.",1
"That's exactly what I mean. The Bard does it all the time, that means it counts",1
Go fuck yourself racist scum,1
You forgot impotent. And yea... personal opinions are one of the best ways to tell if someone is a piece of shit. You couldnt make it any clearer how massive of a piece of shit you are. ,1
Looks like it has the Sanskrit symbol for  Om  near the hilt. Maybe he spent some time with Buddhists or Hindus early on in Asia and trained,1
"They are printing money for free, they are probably ok",1
Woke up on like 4 hours sleep half-awake...clicked this and boom insta-hype fuck coffee I'm ready,1
"Tell us again how you don't like to be sexualized, LOL Anyway: looking hot, as always.",0
 ok i get black widow on the weekends ,3
Lol. Your official contract is over and we're kinda done with your character but here's 20 Mil and a new  movie so people don't bitch.,0
Ehh I see what you did there.,1
"This is so sad , Jarvis play dispacito",1
Wasp will not be in Infinity War. She'll be in Avenger 4.  Ant-Man has a small role in Avengers 3,1
"I thought AoS did him justice, and he wasn t even the focal point of the show, like he would be in Ghost Rider.",1
That's supposed to be an *unpopular* opinion?,3
"Guys, please only ask Kevin about Rampart, ok? His time is valuable.",1
Will there be another team up crossover movie like the avengers,1
"Hilarious, because as a straight white male I thought Captain Marvel was amazing!",1
Barry Lyndon is one of my favourite films but I can see how many would find it boring. Eyes Wide Shut isn t amazing but it s not an all-out failure.,1
"I think so, do you think Batman will be though?",1
And now I will never get to see my favourite marvel character in live action...sorry Feige but this gets a big old F you from me. Edit - Ya'll worship the ground Feige walks on too much.,0
https://imgur.com/a/RUVZUY6 Bonus Incredible Hulk from the Spider-Man sheet back side,2
"Cool! More bottom of the barrel, boring Spiderman teeny bopper films! Sorry I personally think the Spiderman films suck, so bland.",0
"Here in Brazil we have a nickname for him, it's gavigod ",1
"Ah fuck. I'm at work for another 5.5 hours, and I'm over my data cap already. AAAAHHHHHHH.",1
"If you listen to the message again, it s a note in case someone finds the ship after Tony s dead. He s not asking for help, he s just saying goodbye.",3
Will future team up movies be  Avengers  movies or something else?,1
It s not a typical origin story. Whoever told u that needs to go see the movie too,1
"We're also getting a greater density of the TV content too, though.",1
 WHATEVERITTAKES,1
My theory is Disney will reach a new deal after Sony does their own Spider-man/Venom cross-over. I expext a bunch of in-movie references to the situation from both studios that we'll have to accept and gloss over to get back on track.,1
Care to explain? ,1
And Jeff Ford. I wanna know which part of movies that changed because of his input. The  I am Ironman  line before Tony snapped was added because of his suggestion,3
Most of the Marvel TV shows started off great. What I'm hoping for with this new roster is *consistency*,3
"Half of them weren't even jokes. There was no punch line or anything clever.  He just straight up posted about his pedophilia. Not only should he stay fired, he should be investigated. ",3
"1. How, if at all, would you have liked to include (any of) the TV characters in Civil War, Infinity War, or Endgame? 2. If you introduced Nova, would you rather it be Richard or Sam? 3. Which Secret Wars is your favorite? 4. Favorite non-Gauntlet, non-Secret Wars, non-Annihilation event? Ignore the rest of these. 5. McAvoy or Stewart? 6. Amazing or Raimi? 7. What is your name? 8. What is your quest? 9. What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?",1
How did they know to assemble all those people and bring them to the battle? Was there a plan or was this just a plot hole,1
Sup ,1
HYPED,1
How Am I suppose to respond to this?! There has to be doners out there? Right? Also try to relax.,1
I agree. They should have released Captain Marvel in February to give some breathing space between the two. ,1
"I felt the same thing about the Doctor Strange trailers, Mads Mikkelson is a great actor, but some of his lines in the trailer were awful.",2
Oh yeah. Better blond,1
Will iron man ever come back In any future movies ?,1
"It s both. When he s being super, it s fake. When he s walking around and hanging out with fury, it s in the real suit.",3
He exited at Iliff and I-225 South (I was there).,1
"Yeah, do you think they will just keep reusing the same directors over and over? That doesn't make any sense. I mean, we all know they will be bringing in a new director. Not Russo or Waika. They have certain styles and formulas that just doesn't fit guardians. Be realistic here guys",1
Lose*,2
When you don t realize that only movie ticket sales are calculated,1
Wow you look like two completely different people. ,1
Maria=Maria Martha=Marta,1
Cap's shield isn't broken...? ,1
He probably just didn t notice the script because it was too still all the time ,3
Has a moon knight movie or tv show ever been discussed? Also what unknown superhero would you like most to see come to the screen?,1
Hopefully dead along with Black Widow,1
"Yeah some bad taste humor, but calling pedo is a stretch.",0
You're a sick man if you think Broxton has any room for Asgard.,3
lol your post on there is actually pretty funny. Thanks for sharing stranger  ) ,1
"Which was obviously written into the episode after the film, again, not influencing the movies whatsoever.",1
"i definitely did not expect to see him in the first trailer, but i suppose it makes sense. i gasped! i was so happy to see him!! ",1
So thor and hulk are gonna fuck?,1
This. Kinda answers the whole Gamora question outright.,3
"Best, clearly stated idea in months. Five years is a long time and plenty of time to gather a small group and train a team.",1
"Thats fucking insane, dont you dare sell it on ebay. That's like a  1 prized possession.",3
As all things should be. Might be watching Infinity War for the 53rd time today.,3
Suddenly Cap shows up with Mjolnir and stands alone against an entire army - again.,2
"Sony, I've come to bargain.",1
"Lol, what s the theme of the film and how does this moment perfectly portray it?",3
"If all the heroes in the MCU had to fight each other using only their fists, who do you think would win?",1
"I still laud you for your effort, just thought I'd mention it.",1
Who s your favorite Marvel character?,1
"I wasn't familiar with him, so I almost named him as well. But then I remembered he'd been in stuff.",1
"There a tiny glitch while zooming into third eyes, also where can I download this?",1
Pizza time!!,3
Hulk:  you ever try DMT? ,1
"She was the right choice. No other avengers had a relationship with each other, so short of tony bringing pepper to space  it had to come down to those 2.",2
"The last trailer showed Iron Man leaving a heartfelt, dying message to his fianc e, and featured Captain America crying. This one shows Cap in group therapy.  We've seen literally nothing but superheroes being sad, and everyone is fucking hyped. It's incredible how well they've built these characters over the last 10 years, that they can show an image of our heroes crying, no action whatsoever, and general audiences respond with  I need to see this movie ",3
But character assassinations weren't supposed to be towards us... /s ,1
Hey Kevin! What future project are you most excited about? Both for the fans and for yourself,1
I read this in tom Holland's voice for some reason,3
"I guess that the surprise cap and widow has when seeing ant man again is because they were thinking that he was dead right?  I loved the first infinity war trailer way more than this one, I mean compare this with the infamous shot of all heroes running towards battle and the guardians  who the hell are you guys?  revelation, this one felt... flat. I don t know,  what do you guys think? ",1
For whatever reason I read it in Zoe's voice,1
Lol defending Disney,1
Kneel before ur king!,1
What is that cheetah robot looking thingy in the bottom left?,3
is there anywhere i can download this in HD? ,1
Get your game on,3
Thanks for the recommendation. I just never got into console gaming. Nothing against it on my end.,2
And Attack on Titan. Possibly the most exciting arc yet.,3
Oh I didn t know that.,1
"I guess so too. I don't think Ms Marvel will be in this one, maybe in a after credits scene. Hers is the next movie after the second Ant-Man and after that there's already  Infinity War 2 .",1
The more you know!,3
So can we get a shot in the show of them watching Earth as these huge ships invade it and Earth gets fucked? ,1
Do we have a still of just Cap alone against Thanos  entire army yet? Genuinely curious,1
Dude doesn t even break character while riding down the interstate. Now that s dedication as well as the greatest thing I ve seen all morning!,1
No one is that big of a marvel fan,1
Too bad he couldn't do that anymore in Endgame. Somehow having both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker made him a lot weaker.,1
It really says something though that you took a position on the matter  apparently before you ever even read what he had said...and how many times he said it,2
Damn. I'm kind of irritated I missed that.,1
Looks like they're in a place off Earth for that fight.,1
22 year Old Thanos is a stud lol. Guess he grew older and became....Daddy?,1
"Thank you! I'm not alone! I also didn't like how long the pause was...i get *why* there was a pause, but it felt like forever. Shorten it up and speak up ffs",1
I am all winners something something dead meme. ,2
THE AVENGERS THEME ,3
"IK, but James Gunn just made him look more fun in GOTG",1
you would think after the Masterpiece that was the Thor Ragnarok teaser that they have learned by now how to make the Audience hyped and excited for a new entry to the series but then they give us this shit seriously I slept halfway through and what's with her voice? it sounds too whiny and annoying if she turns out to really be stronger than Thor it will feel forced and unearned ,2
  Will Nova's film be post end game or after next unannounced films? greetings and thank you for reading,1
George Carlin didn't joke about fucking children. ,0
"They'll probably continue that trend but reduce the MCU's reliance on him or his rogues gallery. Keep inserting MCU refs, stories, and characters into his solo movies to make them reliant on Marvel but reduce the Spidey focus in the larger MCU stories.",3
"Thor Ragnarok also takes time  3- leaven drama with humor- to an EXTREME. It may not be breaking the rules, but it certainly is a problem.",1
The power..... of Jay-Z.,1
">Pretty sure Thanos **doesn't** ha**ve** enough firepower to destroy a **fucking Celestial the size of a planet** to its core without stones. And with them, All he d need is the **a completed Infinity Gauntlet** tbh.",0
"Thanks for that! Also RIP Peter, still not quite over that one yet",3
And the OG guy that used to date Ramona Flowers. ,3
"Groot is a fucking living conscious organism, he dies just like everyone else within your own dumbass logic. That s if you for some reason don t want to trust the DIRECTORS who said ALL life had been snapped. That includes all kinds of animals and plants etc. ",0
"If you watch that scene again where he blinks out in slow motion you can see he uses the time, space, mind, and reality stones at the same time. It happens really fast in the scene.",1
Yeah what does that even mean? How can something digital that doesnt exist in the physical space have back or front ends?,3
"Hi Mr.Feige, what language did you get your last name from? My Chinese name is Fei Ge and I get happy when I see your name comes up in the credits.",1
Always good to see people wich fame didn't get up in their heads so they kept cool and humble over the years... we all know how much Hollywood needs all the decency possible. ,3
Need to blow that thread up.,1
Its spelt taylor in my head only.,1
"Monica Rambeau, the second Captain Marvel! Carol Danvers was the seventh one. I'm still not sure why they went with Carol over Monica (especially since Monica's character is better written, from what I've gathered). Well, racist China could play a part (Black Panther didn't do as well there as it did in the west, AFAIK). Edit: Why are you booing me?",0
"fuck, man",1
"IMO Evans make a good point though. Some features are neat, but some so completely unnecessary it s laughable. ",1
Wish that wasn't the case. It would show that undoing the snap brought other consequences,0
Have you seen  the movie Fanboys (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489049/?ref =fn al tt 1)? Very similar situation!,1
"Hi Mr. Feige, I hope you're well, thanks for everything! Super simple. Do you think we will ever get to see a good representation of the awesomeness that is Doctor Doom on screen?",1
"Good, but i still think it was a publicity stunt",1
I think I prefer Blu-Ray. Doesn't hurt my eyes as much.,1
 Guns are too fast. You can't savour all the moments ,3
"RIP Stan, excelsior ",1
"Forgive my ignorance, can anyone please tell me which Anime is this parodying? I've seen so many parodies I just want to see the original for once.",1
William Hurt / Incredible Hulk. And Civil War. And Infinity War. ,1
That's a shame. I was really hoping to see Thanos affect multiple movies.,1
 Here's something everyone overlooked in *previous movie*  -- with link to image or video of main plot point.,3
"Looks like they take Vision to Wakanda to protect him, being the reason for Thanos to attack Wakanda. Also, how the fuck is Cap that strong?",1
I am not crying. Take your damn upvote.,1
"A trailer arrives not too late, nor too early. It arrives exactly like its supposed to. ",3
Didn't he fly Cap into dangerous enemy territory in the movie? That's pretty selfless.,2
"It was accessible to the public and available for anyone to see. As the employer, I think a reasonable person would expect a company of Disney s stature to do their due diligence here and should have known about it prior to hiring and I would go so far as to say they did know.  How would that argument stand up? ",1
You should never take stan twitter seriously tbh.,3
"Hey Kevin, loving your work with the MCU. Any thoughts on Fantastic Four now the rights are back with you? Would they be set in a contemporary setting or do you see them as a retro outfit, with a 50S/60s origin story? Maybe ending up in the present day with their new powers after a mission gone wrong!",1
First was Mario Mario.,1

"Shit, I wish.",1
"I had just read the book in high school and loved it so I tried to watch the movie. One of the few movies I couldn't finish, it was so awful.",0
"Hopefully this sort of support from the cast marks the beginning of the end of the  shoot first, ask questions later  approach we've been seeing in Hollywood. Going back in people's past and trying to expose their actions then with today's principles is one of the most asinine things I've ever seen. ",1
i think this might be overdoing it,2
Oh boy I can read and I can read that you chose to focus on that part.  I can read that you falsely claim that the left started it without anything to back it up.,1
"I loved the end fight. I found it so much better than the similar setup  everyone vs. a pile of aliens  scene in Infinity War. Everyone coming out of the portals was one of the most hype things, somehow more awesome than Cap going to town on Thanos with Mjolnir.",3
"Thanos didn't kill half of all sentient life, he killed half of all life. It makes sense he'd go into it super hard right away to make sure he had enough lol",1
"Really? You do a gruelling, emotional, 3 hour performance (not even including prep time etc.) and then go out into the night to meet fans? Wow. Guy's dedicated.",1
"Holy Matchcut batman, this was glorious",1
"Tony talking to Pepper and mentioning Rescue and her thinking it fun. Hint? Also, think Tony and Nebula banged it out? ",1
That would be so disappointing. ,3
"Dude, like where did that come from? What about the discussion of the future of Spider-Man in the MCU prompted the American hate?",1
"Hi Kevin.  Big fan, excellent work on this whole franchise over the last several years.  I've always felt like there was one big media aspect missing from the whole family, though... video games that don't suck.  We had a couple back in the early days of the MCU (there was an Iron man game and a Captain America game, I believe, but they weren't good).  Is there a reason why more quality games haven't come out to accompany the movies?  Is that a medium for storytelling that you would like to explore?",1
I watched it twice. I did my part  ,1
The whole point of Disney+ is it gives a platform to characters and stories that will never make it to the big screen - not characters already getting prime release dates,2
"Space Odyssey sucks, Blade Runner is a much better scifi movie.",1
"The old one is Dolph Lundgren, kiddo. ",1
"They're speaking to the insinuation that a Wagner opera has any objectively superior value to a day at Six Flags. Spoiler: it doesn't. Of course the reverse is also true since neither is intrinsically superior to the other. Eye of the beholder and all that. But then, nobody here was going out of their way to call The Godfather despicable.",1

how about Iron Man getting knocked the FUCK out,2
"Lol wut Currently it is superhero movies that are big, in a few years it will be something else, there are tons and tons of different genres that have been popular since movies were a thing, monster movies at one point were the big thing, vampire movies, spoofs, calm your tits and just be patient and don't be mad that the majority of people on earth want something you don't.",2
Their sacrifices were already cheap to begin with because they didn't have to die. It was shoddy writing plain and simple.,1
I agree with you. But you will get crucified for not liking AoS here.,0
>I don t see it having any impact on continuity Direct impact? Literally zero. Indirect impact?  Every good episode will be turned into a movie. (https://www.sparknotes.com/blog/7-times-marvel-what-if-scenarios-became-full-blown-stories/),3
"What are the plans for Stan Lee cameos in future movies? Have they all already been prerecorded? Or will it be more surprising like a hidden picture of Stan? I don t expect to see Stan Lee recasted or filled in via CGI. I think Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one, so if there is going to be a change, now would be the time to do it.",1

YAY!!!,1
I don't see anyone,0
Can you not,3
Loki and Heimdall weren't snapped or shown.,3
"The selective colour montage at the start shows Avengers that died in the snap, black and white with red popping out. Black means death, red means evil and bloodshed. then it cuts to the marvel studios logo turning to dust just like they did.",2
 It seemed like a good idea at the time. (url),2
That may have been me by mistake.,1

Lmao right?! Like what's super interesting about this exactly?,2
I don t dislike her but she did say a lot of stupid things leading up to the movie which made me like her less. The movie was meant to promote feminism which is fine but then she went on that rant which rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I would hardly call that a pathetic reason for disliking her. In the end I would say this movie was just okay. Not bad but it wasn t that good either. And it grossed over  1B because it s the first female led marvel movie which was a big deal.,0
Bobby Newport never had a real job in his life. ,3
Speaking of...,1
I want to go in with as little as possible. For those who watched. Should i avoid this. Ughhhh this is soo hard lol,1
"No, you re right. The editing department was just trying to be fancy and went with the obvious play on words. They don t need to say  Watch HER become a hero,  to tell us she s a woman, because clearly everyone can see and hear that she s a woman! It s not some mystery. ",3
We have set pics of Steve Nat and Scott at a diner though so that s probably what happens after he comes to them ,1
"I think a lot of people did, myself included. I remember being on one of the first threads about it jumping on the hate train. Later after looking into it more, and also having more context for some of those tweets, I was too gung-ho about canning Gunn for what amounts to nothing more than a few sketch tweets, 10 years ago, dug up by someone with an agenda. Welcome back, James! ",1
I don't know why people rely on big name actors to decide how good a movie is.  It only determines how much money they have to throw at it.,0
Yeah the spin on this was kinda crazy from Sony's camp. Somehow convinced everyone Sony is just some mom-and-pop shop when they're also a huge corporation.,3
"There's your opening to the Black Widow movie. Cap vs Skull, Cap gets Widow back. Only she can't go back until after the Endgame.

is there something funny?,0
"Endgame spoiler. >!I know this is basically confirmed to be a prequel, but I'd love it to be set after her death with some Red Room cloning thing (similar to the recent ressurection storyline) and seeing her slowly regaining memories and finding her humanity again! ",1
I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that. The trailer made me assume she was a super minor character.,2

He'll get his third movie and appear in Shang Chi since they're both based in New York. After all this, then both parties would have to negotiate.",1

Even in real life there are still Marvel Easter eggs,3
"So does this open the flood gates for movies to not stop at a third installment? I know Avengers broke that but that was a crossover film and everyone kind of assumed it was an  exception  not the rule. With Thor 4 coming out, does that mean we may get GOTG 4 or Spider-Man 4? Or hell, even Captain America 4 with Falcon at the helm?",1

This is so wholesome! I love this pic,1
"When guys like Coppola and Scorsese complain about super hero movies, all I m hearing is a couple of old men bitter that the times are changing.",1
Could be Loki...everything is possible,1
We can t really blame him. A lot of the older MCU actors just don t view the MCU the way we do. They see it as a paycheque and a quick way to get their name out there. Look at Gwenyth Paltrow. She still has no idea what films she was in.,3
He s got the same lovable idealistic attitude that Chris Evans brought to the role of Captain America. Or as Tony would call it: giddy optimism. I m really pulling for this guy and this movie.,1
The pessimist in me thinks he was just there to pay respects. The optimist in me wants to see him in an iron man suit next to spidey,3
Disney needs to come Up with some 4th wall breaking in their Next movie to address this,1
"Based on Thor: Ragnarok,  a ship (probably Thanos) happens upon the Asgardian refugee ship. I am guessing that Thanos destroys that ship and send Thor flying into space where he runs into the GotG and maybe sent Hulk to Earth as a warning to mankind  ( spoiler)",2
I could see the Jackal saying that.,3
"Upvote from me. I was going to post this a couple months ago but I never got around to it. I love that scene, I remember it was the first time my feelings towards Nebula changed.",3
That would be amazing ngl,1
what is it about?,1
"I'm willing to bet that his return has some kind of play in the plot to stop Thanos. For all we know, it was a ruse to push some plan of his. I know some people seem comfortable with his arch ending there but he's the best shot at a wildcard coming in late to seal the deal on their victory. ",1

"I've heard tell that this is basically a Thanos movie. Which makes sense, given such a huge cast, you need to have *a* focus.",1
I'm not sure what he said but I'm getting sick of the social media Mob mentality. I understand what ever he said it was 11 years ago. Some people can say what ever they want and get no punishment. Other say one thing and get fired. at the end of the day we have freedom of speech and people make mistakes.  If we are not allow to express ourselves we will just be  PC  robots. ,1

Drax definitely has the most elegant signature ,1
Which is a bit strange. Daniel Drumm was the master of the New York Sanctum during the events of Dr. Strange and because he died Strange replaced him. It had been 5 years though by the time we see him in guardianship of that one. So maybe the Ancient One was protecting it back then or was subbing in for him,1

Andrew Garfield was not.",1
I don't see anyone to thank,1
"So you say? But if we're being objective, most terror attacks in western countries are from far-right and Christian actors. So if objectively we define groups by their worst...? Or if we define all Muslims from the worst of Islam we have to do the same across the board to stay objective? So Christianity is defined by not allowing women to teach, calls for genocide against non-christians (Samuel), condoning of human trafficking (Peter), etc etc.",1
Ironic that one of Coppola's best movies is Lost In Translation,1
"Phase 2 was where I think we began seeing an increasing mandate on the funny stuff in the movies. The early movies definitely had jokes, but those were more balanced out with serious moments. There are still a few examples that did a good job balancing the humor like the Captain America sequels and Black Panther, but AOU was where the whole criticism of  Everything serious needs to be undercut with a gag  started to actually gain some traction for me.",1

"As far as existing characters/movies go I feel like Doctor Strange would be a pretty good fit for him, but based on his previous movies I feel like one centered around a small team/team-up would be awesome.

> Sly time travel confirmation? seems so..look at this pocket watch..it flashes green https://imgur.com/a/jn6mw82,0
That's a big logistical problem. The movies are written and filmed usually years before the parallel episode in SHIELD is written  and filmed. So SHIELD will always reference the movies more than the other way around unless it is planned way in advance (like in Ultron). ,1

I find your lack of faith disturbing ,2
i mean sure but Clint's reaction is out of shock and sadness. Everyone else is kneeling as if that's something people do...when its not. Especially since some of them barely knew Tony  I'm really glad they decided to cut this out and went with the funeral sequence.,3

He makes movies about talking raccoons for people with arrested development so its okay.,0

To this day I will never understand why there was so much backlash over Ledger's casting. He had just shown off going from Lords of Dogtown to Brokeback Mountain that he had tremendous range as an actor and was just starting to tap into it at that point in his career. And not only that but he had the look for it too with that long face and wide grin of his. I never understood why people couldn't see him potentially pulling off a great Joker portrayal.,3

I'm mentioning this because the cosmic civilizations most likely had studied and developed technology around the infinity stones ages ago.",2
I disagree. The 90s script is unrivaled for Spider-Man dialogue but Spectacular has excellent Spidey inner-monologue too and it has much better choreography. It's a slightly more quality series.,2

Think so? I m curious to see if there s any disconnect. I mean I m on mobile so I don t want to post spoilers but I feel like a movie about a character that clearly has a future movie in time sequence (Infinity War   Endgame) kinda lessens the stakes knowing she makes it out and develops into a good character. As opposed to it coming out before all that stuff to build the character. If that makes sense.,2
Shield Avengers Online,1
"Hopefully not *exactly* like Spider-Man. They didn't just omit his origin, they go out of their way as often as possible to not mention it. Frankly, I'm not sure if Uncle Ben even exists in this universe, nobody has brought him up even when it would've made sense to.",1

"Not just that it's not a worthy reason, but specifically an unworthy reason. Also, I don't see it as happening at that moment. I saw it as his worthy character contradicting with his unworthy motivations. One part says he should be able to, another says he shouldn't. So you end up with him being able to nudge it a bit and that's it.",1

The accords is a collection of documents signed by 117 countries and it is enforced by the UN.,2
"That's a fair enough opinion, although not every film needs a  villain , a threat can suffice, and Hulk has always been a character that the heroes have had to stop on occasion. I can see, however why the culmination of these films can't end with one of the heroes being the antagonist, though.",1

"That and the hammer were my favorites, so amazing!",1
Guess you can say he stuck with his gunns,1
I think it was the reason to have captain marvel in the movie. Strong thor could have easily destroyed the ship and taken on thanos on his own.,2
"His signature is never the same, so it would be hard to prove it's his anyway. Go look on google image for his autograph. It's not at all consistent. A few of them are  similar , but it would be just as similar if you tried to forge his signature and  almost  got it right.",3

OH MY FUCNING GOD,3
My bubble of what actually happened? I pointed you to evidence. What you're claiming is impossible with the system they had set up. Or do you just think that reality changed Berenstain Bears style?,1
"One thing I didn't get with this scene was where are all these Asgardians coming from? Hela killed off a ton of their warriors in Ragnarok, Thanos killed another half that were on the ship, and then presumably another half got snapped. Bruce only brought back the people that were snapped, so the Asgardians should still be very low on numbers. But in this it seems like they came in almost full force.",3
"Um, yeah, I know. My point is that this was a literal end of the world scenario and it's surprising to me that the worst that happened to a main character like Cap is that he got a little tired.",1
I think it s the eyes/nose specifically.,1
"Going by what it costs for certain autographs at ACE and other conventions, I estimate he's got about 4200 in signatures alone, plus whatever he spent on the shield. Value on these kinda things tend to compound with all the signatures. To the right person I'm sure you could sell it for at least 8 to 10 grand",2

"But in the interviews, they've been adamant that Cap lives out his life in the main timeline with Peggy. In the Winter Soldier and Civil War, Sharon has been established as being close with  Aunt Peggy . Wouldn't she have known her husband? Wouldn't he have been Uncle Steve? Wouldn't *she* have known, even if he didn't?",1

"I mean, being a big name in wrestling isn't all it's cracked up to be. Aside from ludicrous work hours - like at least 300 days out of the year touring constantly - the crap they put their bodies through, specifically the big guys like Dave, can take it's toll. I think most wrestling stars want different careers after wrestling.  At least something to do when they retire.",1
"My roommate loves comics and is gonna do the same since we found Preacher. She loves Watchmen and sees some something in them both. If you haven't yet, take a look at that one too.",1

God forbid some movies not be entirely focused on white dudes for a change. Why so butt hurt?,1
Not sudden for me,1
"I think there has to be a balance, for the small films, I really have no worries about it feeling weird with a power balance cause they never really had that huge of villains. And when it comes to big team up films, you can raise the stakes in other ways than one person just being too OP. Like a Skrull Wars film wouldn't need a big bad to feel engaging, they would have the suspense of not knowing who is friend or foe between characters that trusted each other.",1
"Eh I think that s a bit unfair. Tom Holland gets to show way more emotional range due to his character.There is a inherent stoic quality to tchalla and since he s a king we don t gets to see him show too much range. Not know king on either,they both did fantastic jobs in there respective roles.I just don t think we can say one did better than the other.",1

"Yeah that Civil War suit like, awakened something in me",3
Here's hoping for a Tony Stark cameo in the multiverse,2
  will. He was a great director and Guardians is a huge smash hit. The staff like working with him and came out in support of him. ,0

"Honestly yeah. The San Francisco housing market is insane. A house like that would cost tens of millions of dollars. Scott isn t rich, nor does he come from a rich family, he definitely did not inherit it. Like it s not a big deal but watching the movie for the first time it did break my immersion a little, because my immediate thought was  there s no way Scott could ever even afford what it would cost to rent that house.

Oh definitely. I can see these negotiations ironing out in the next few weeks. Even Deadline said they overshot a bit. Maybe a 90/10 or 85/15 split is gonna be agreed upon.,1
I noticed that too!,1
"And even if they don't, at least this should give them the opportunity to give Spidey a proper sendoff in the MCU instead of being forced to abandon his story on a cliffhanger like in Far From Home",2

Awesome! Eager to watch this movie. ,1
Don't let this distract you from the fact that we now have a movie where Spider-Man RIDES A FUCKING PEGASUS,1
Peasants it comes out on the 24th in my country  ,1
This was the perfect trailer. WE LITERALLY KNOW NOTHING.,2
War machine is upgraded differently than iron man! War machine is heavy on the offensive like big guns and multiple weapons and explosives like we saw in infinity war! Iron man is about all over efficient. Also Tony really wants to keep the status as iron man to himself.,1
"genuine question, what is his deal with earth? like in the movies he came back for that final fight with Thanos, is that the first time he's been back since he was taken??",2

I hate viral marketing so much.,0
Me too thanks ,1
"So I guess we're at the point in time where the 90s, complete with Blockbuster Home Video nostalgia, is becoming a new time period for new movies to be set in. ",1
"Definitely more of a Black Gate vibe here. The Gauntlet is the One Ring and the real goal, and the character mocked for being useless compared to others (Hawkeye/Frodo) is the one carrying it. The armies clashing are a last ditch effort to stop the ultimate evil.",1
This is just horrifying  ,2

"Hi Kevin! First, thanks for your diligence, not only in seeing the MCU through to the point where it is a historic phenomenon, but also throughout your career in pursuing your passion. Knowing you're love of cinema that drove you to persist in the early days of your education and career, I'd like to know what movies or movie franchises from the history of Hollywood would you love to see as another sweeping cinematic universe?",1

Eh there are plenty of very  normal  movies I like while tripping too...mostly just depends on the coloring and effects. Rick and Morty is still my go-to acid media though. Very good weird.,1
"...was he? **Edit:** I just watched YouTube. You are right. I completely forgot about him. Blink stole the fuck out of that scene, and for some reason, within my own mind, I thought Sunspot was Sunfire. The memory I had in my head had him being Asian --- that same memory had for whatever reason assigned all of Bishop's scenes to Warpath.",1
"Was anything from Edgar Wright s ant man script used in the final product? Or was it abandoned altogether for the world building? And when you first started working in the movie business, was infinity war and endgame always in your mind even back then?",1
"Pretty much all of Phase 4 is gonna be either cosmic or Mahershala Ali being a half-vampire and it's got me GASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSED. And they're getting loads of younger, more ambitious directors so hopefully it's just gonna be a bit mental. Now Endgame is finished, I feel like they're just gonna say 'fuck it' and experiment loads.",1
"You seem very sweet, replying to so many people.   How do you figure out how to stitch the whole thing together?",1

Let's get to the real deep questions now Kevin.. ENOUGH PLAYING AROUND!! So boobs or ass?,1
Would you settle for a version where you and a friend can pick your favorite characters to play a game of Bridge?,1
"It was originally supposed to be while Bruce was fighting Cull Obsidian. The original plan was for Bruce to basically beg Hulk to help, Hulk refusing, and the two of them eventually reconciling into Professor Hulk, who'd burst out of the armor and beat the shit out of Obsidian. It wasn't cut because it didn't fit anywhere, it was cut because the Russos didn't like giving the Avengers a win in the 3rd act.",3
shockedpikachuface.jpg,1
Why weren't the leitmotifs of our favourite Marvel heroes used across all the movies they starred in and mainly just stuck inside of the solo movies? It was fixed in Endgame but I was just wondering why this wasn't done so heavily in previous Marvel movies. Thanks!,1
"Kevin, you mofo, I can't believe you've pulled this off.",1
"You have no proof he didn't save Bucky in the alternate timeline...these assumptions about Steve not fixing things in the alternate timeline seem way off, why would you assume he didn't?",3

Would you ever consider revisiting the older marvel movies to fix thing that don t match the continuity (  la star wars) I m dying to see a version of the first Iron man with Don Cheadle Thank you for 11 years of quality films!,1

"The hate is fucking unreal. Fukbois complaining about it being a woman-led super hero film need to chill, and cuckbois praising it for being a woman-led super hero film need to chill. Who's excited for the next Marvel franchise because they're marvel/movie fans? I AM!",3
"They make 100's of times more money than actual original unique movies, recycling the same shit over and over again. Its okay for them to be a little salty about it, when it has such a large impact on the industry as a whole.",0
"There have been a lot of debates over whether Daredevil or other Netflix Marvel shows are truly canon to the MCU. I know that they were not developed by Marvel Studios but I was wondering how collaborative were you guys along the development process of the shows, and were the Netflix characters ever an option to appear on movie side, Infinity War for instance? I've never seen your opinion about it and would really appreciate a definitive answer on this.",3

Captain America is a traitor and I hate him.,1
"If you re in a scene with somebody... that somebody should be part of the scene. I was just watching a friend do a scene and it was just her half - she was just on the phone. But the other actress called in while in the middle of a 6 hour drive to be on the other end of that call.  Acting isn t  pretending . Acting is making emotion real! And if you are isolated completely it isn t just harder to give a great performance, it takes a real toll on your psyche ",1
Dormammu I ve come to bargain,1
I'm not prepared for the severe depression this movie is going to give me.,1
I separate the art from the artist.,1

Yes Please,1
This should have been the trailer,1
I think people only want Tom Hardy as Logan is because they're roughly the same height.,2
"Hey Kevin! Firstly, thank you so much for everything you've done for cinema and superheroes. I've got a bit of a generic question for ya, but one I've been wondering: Who was your favorite superhero growing up (and might still be today)?  I'm also curious if you have a favorite in both Marvel and DC universes, I love 'em both. :)",1
"Hi Kevin Feige! Thank you for creating marvel cinematic universe! I had one question regarding endgame, what will happen to Loki considering he escaped from Thor and other avengers after New York Battle?",1

"It nearly always gets referred to as  equal pay for equal work , which suggests that people are being paid unequally for doing the exact same things. I don't have an issue with people wanting to address economic inequalities, but the way that people tend to do it only misinforms and stokes outrage in wrong directions, ignoring the actual root of the problem.",1
How the hell have you not seen proof of this already? I'm not going to go find it for you. It's up to you to educate yourself. If you lack the simple ability to look up Huston Huddleston then I'm not sure what I can do for you.,1
"He was great in that Star Trek opening scene too. I remember him really standing out, like who this guy?",3
He also flips houses for a ton of money.,3
"Irony is more specific than that. It has to directly contravene the expectations and do so deliberately.  Is ironic when a flame retardant material which specifically isn't supposed to light on fire, lights on fire.  It's not ironic that I have different thoughts than you on a piece of media. Your idea of who should have thoughts based on ones enjoyment of something is fallacious and thus isn't reasonable to expect me not to have thoughts.  It's not in the same planet as irony.",1
And that took some of the sting away when watching that scene. IW could be (and probably is) after Spidey 2 so it could go either way.,1
"Well, you have excellent bone structure there. I'm kinda having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?",1
What s a blockbuster *daddy*?,1
This is exactly what's gonna happen lmao.,1
Question was there ever plans to do a world breaker hulk or has the arc always been planned as professor hulk,1
So there s been this build up of damage iron man had been suffering with his left arm which prompted a lot of people to believe that it would be the arm to unsnap and save the universe to come full circle. Any particular reason why it didn t happen?,1
That whole season was so good. Three distinct parts with their own flavour and then it all comes together in a way that surprisingly makes sense.,3
"Yeah, I usually keep original photos with just a bit of improved lighting (unless the light is very bad originally so i have to 'save' the photo) but I really wanted a poster-style photo for Captain Marvel. Too sad I don't have enough skill haha. Would make much more sense with the power effect. And definitely looks better on a phone screen. But thank you for your comments, I'll keep them in mind!",1
I do. Now what?,3

"Get your shit together, man. WE DEMAND PERFECTION!",3
Phase 2 begins..,2
They ll never reboot the MCU. Even characters like Stark s daughter is set up to be the new Iron-(wo)Man 10 years from now. I imagine interest will dwindle and it ll come to a natural close before its ever rebooted.,1
That shit is ORGASMIC,1
Reminds me of those old marvel cards that would be a full page (9 cards) that make up a scene. Really awesome work!,1

Never have I been so happy to have watched a sporting event,1
"Perhaps if Hela had remained in control of Asgard and the vaults that held the Tesseract Thanos would not have been able to so easily acquire the space stone. Hela was able to crush Mjolnir effortlessly with her hand, she was super powerful and perhaps could have held her own against Thanos if he didn't have all the stones. ",3
Have you or anybody else considered doing anything with Captain Britain?,1
Dam that us seriously cool,1
Where is she? I didn't see her in the trailer.,1
Africa still arrives.,1
"Wait, how does he return the soul stone? Does he just hand it back like don't want this any more thanks",2

"Oh good, I'm glad you know what you're talking about. There's this myth flying around that Marcia Lucas is the secret genius behind star wars, and it's nonsense. Gary Kurtz was Lucas's producer on American Graffiti, ANH, ESB and was his closest collaborator. Marcia definitely gave feedback on the script for Star Wars, and had a huge influence as one of the editors, but it's not like she was there day-to-day on set of all his movies like Kurtz was.",2

"She controls vibrations, She can see in the dark.",1
"Let's not forget about the rumors of a Venom/Spider-Man crossover. Though I much prefer Flash Thompson over Eddie Brock, it'd be cool to see Venom teaming up with Spider-Man, especially considering the foreshadowing of Carnage in both Spider-Man 3 and Venom (though I'm more excited for a Silk movie.)",1
We're in the Gameboy now.,1
"Nope. If it was then they'd reveal this just before the next Spidey movie in 2021, not right now, just after a Spider-Man movie.",1
You get a single upvote from me,1
"Here's what I think They'll do a PG-13 Deadpool. Although it's a 3rd Deadpool movie, it won't be the 3rd, it will be used as a soft reboot. They'll probably have Cable, Domino and Colossus returning but not sure of the others. It will be like Incridible Hulk got a sequel with Ruffalo. Instead, they use some elements of the original franchise to build a new one. But it will certainly not continue what came before.",1
"Feige: Hmm, *executive* producer, eh? Singer: It's a meaningless title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves.",2
"Well yeah that's not the part we're meant to empathize with. He's still clearly the villain. But he had an upbringing that a lot of people relate to, and it's important to show that talent and positive sentiment can be corrupted in the wrong environment. They showed that at his core he was trying to right an injustice, but his life up to that point, combined with poor choices, led to him going about it in the wrong way",1
" Tony Stark built this on a rock in space.... with a pile of scraps! I agree with you. I'd hate it if it's coincidental. But likely it won't be. If someone rescues him, he probably triggered something.",1
"Again, still disagree, but yeah. Thanks for talking to me, and have a nice day.",1

Ok, so my question is: What s the most innocuous detail or plot line that the writers, directors or even cast suggested to you for inclusion in any film that you had to veto for the most ridiculous reason.

Guys I think the giant red planet shown in the beginning of the trailer is actually Earth and the big hurricane with the giant eye in the middle is centered on Manhattan.  Also lens flare shines right through Tony s head. Watch him die by getting impaled through the side. I noticed Drax had flare on him too in the end. Based on the leaked footage it s possible he dies when charging on Thanos.,1
"That's true. And that was in theaters for years as the times were different, so the comparison isn't entirely fair. The fact is there is no end-all means to see which movie the title of highest grossing movie truly belongs to. However, it's definitely not Endgame.

"The MCU became such a powerhouse over the years and managed to get the rights to Xmen and the F4, while also securing a deal for Spidey. Do you think with the DCEU not being as profitable as WB would have liked, that it opens a door for an Avengers Vs Justice League movie in aobut a decade?",1

">Also Hulk bursting out of the Hulkbuster would have been iconic. Kinda wish he did so when they went to The Farm in Endgame, even if briefly. He actually was planned to after finding out that there was no way to reverse the snap. He would have busted out of the armor, pissed, and Carol would have been trying to calm him down.
